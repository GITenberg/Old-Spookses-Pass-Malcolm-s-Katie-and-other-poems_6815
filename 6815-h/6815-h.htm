<p class="poem">
  We'd camp'd that night on Yaller Bull Flat&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thar was Possum Billy, an' Tom, an' me.<br />
  Right smart at throwin' a lariat<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was them two fellers, as ever I see;<br />
  An' for ridin' a broncho, or argyin' squar<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the devil roll'd up in the hide of a mule,<br />
  Them two fellers that camp'd with me thar<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would hev made an' or'nary feller a fool.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  II.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Fur argyfyin' in any way,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thet hed to be argy'd with sinew an' bone,<br />
  I never see'd fellers could argy like them;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But just right har I will hev to own<br />
  Thet whar brains come in in the game of life,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They held the poorest keerds in the lot;<br />
  An' when hands was shown, some other chap<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rak'd in the hull of the blam'd old pot!<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  III.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We was short of hands, the herd was large,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An' watch an' watch we divided the night;<br />
  We could hear the coyotes howl an' whine,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the darn'd critters kept out of sight<br />
  Of the camp-fire blazin'; an' now an' then<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thar come a rustle an' sort of rush,<br />
  A rattle a-sneakin' away from the blaze,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thro' the rattlin', cracklin' grey sage bush.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  IV.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We'd chanc'd that night on a pootyish lot,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a tol'ble show of tall, sweet grass&mdash;<br />
  We was takin' Speredo's drove across<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rockies, by way of "Old Spookses' Pass"&mdash;<br />
  An' a mite of a creek went crinklin' down,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a "pocket" bust in the rocks overhead,<br />
  Consid'able shrunk, by the summer drought,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a silver streak in its gravelly bed.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  V.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Twas a fairish spot fur to camp a' night;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An' chipper I felt, tho' sort of skeer'd<br />
  That them two cowboys with only me,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Couldn't boss three thousand head of a herd.<br />
  I took the fust of the watch myself;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An' as the red sun down the mountains sprang,<br />
  I roll'd a fresh quid, an' got on the back<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of my peart leetle chunk of a tough mustang.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  VI.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  An' Possum Billy was sleepin' sound,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Es only a cowboy knows how to sleep;<br />
  An' Tommy's snores would hev made a old<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffalo bull feel kind o' cheap.<br />
  Wal, pard, I reckin' thar's no sech time<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For dwind'lin' a chap in his own conceit,<br />
  Es when them mountains an' awful stars,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jest hark to the tramp of his mustang's feet.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  VII.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  It 'pears to me that them solemn hills<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckin' them stars so big an' calm,<br />
  An' whisper, "Make tracks this way, my friends,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We've ring'd in here a specimen man;<br />
  He's here alone, so we'll take a look<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thro' his ganzy an' vest, an' his blood an' bone,<br />
  An post ourselves as to whether his heart<br />
   Is <i>flesh</i>, or a rotten, made-up stone!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  VIII.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  An' it's often seemed, on a midnight watch,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the mountains blacken'd the dry, brown sod,<br />
  That a chap, if he shut his eyes, might grip<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great kind hand of his Father-God.<br />
  I rode round the herd at a sort of walk&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadders come stealin' thick an' black;<br />
  I'd jest got to leave tew that thar chunk<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a mustang tew keep in the proper track.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  IX.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Ever see'd a herd ring'd in at night?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wal, it's sort of cur'us,&mdash;the watchin' sky,<br />
  The howl of coyotes&mdash;a great black mass,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With thar an' thar the gleam of a eye<br />
  An' the white of a horn&mdash;an', now an' then,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An' old bull liftin' his shaggy head,<br />
  With a beller like a broke-up thunder growl&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An' the summer lightnin', quick an' red,<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  X.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Twistin' an' turnin' amid the stars,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent as snakes at play in the grass,<br />
  An' plungin' thar fangs in the bare old skulls<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the mountains, frownin' above the Pass.<br />
  An' all so still, that the leetle creek,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twinklin' an crinklin' from stone to stone,<br />
  Grows louder an' louder, an' fills the air<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a cur'us sort of a singin' tone.<br />
  It ain't no matter wharever ye be,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I'll 'low it's a cur'us sort of case)<br />
  Whar thar's runnin' water, it's sure to speak<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of folks tew home an' the old home place;<br />

</p>

<p class="poem">
  An' yer bound tew listen an' hear it talk,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Es yer mustang crunches the dry, bald sod;<br />
  Fur I reckin' the hills, an' stars, an' creek<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are all of 'em preachers sent by God.<br />
  An' them mountains talk tew a chap this way:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Climb, if ye can, ye degenerate cuss!"<br />
  An' the stars smile down on a man, an say,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come higher, poor critter, come up tew us!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  XII.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  An' I reckin', pard, thar is One above<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The highest old star that a chap can see,<br />
  An' He says, in a solid, etarnal way,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ye never can stop till ye get to ME!"<br />
  Good fur Him, tew! fur I calculate<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HE ain't the One to dodge an' tew shirk,<br />
  Or waste a mite of the things He's made,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or knock off till He's finished His great Day's work!<br />

  We've got to labor an' strain an' snort<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along thet road thet He's planned an' made;<br />
  Don't matter a mite He's cut His line<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tew run over a 'tarnal, tough up-grade;<br />
  An' if some poor sinner ain't built tew hold<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Es big a head of steam es the next,<br />
  An' keeps slippin' an' slidin' 'way down hill,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, He don't make out that He's awful vex'd.<br />

<p class="poem">
  Fur He knows He made Him in that thar way,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhars tew fit In His own great plan,<br />
  An' He ain't the Bein' tew pour His wrath<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the head of thet slimpsy an' slippery man,<br />
  An' He says tew the feller, "Look here, my son,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're the worst hard case that ever I see,<br />
  But be thet it takes ye a million y'ars,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye never can stop till ye git tew ME!"<br />

  Thet's free to tote up es ugly a log<br />

  MALCOLM'S KATIE: A LOVE STORY<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  PART I.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Max plac'd a ring on little Katie's hand,<br />
  A silver ring that he had beaten out<br />
  From that same sacred coin&mdash;first well-priz'd wage<br />
  For boyish labour, kept thro' many years.<br />
  "See, Kate," he said, "I had no skill to shape<br />
  Two hearts fast bound together, so I grav'd<br />
  Just K. and M., for Katie and for Max."<br />
  "But, look; you've run the lines in such a way,<br />
  That M. is part of K., and K. of M.,"<br />
  Said Katie, smiling. "Did you mean it thus?<br />
  I like it better than the double hearts."<br />
  "Well, well," he said, "but womankind is wise!<br />
  Yet tell me, dear, will such a prophecy<br />
  Not hurt you sometimes, when I am away?<br />
  Will you not seek, keen ey'd, for some small break<br />
  In those deep lines, to part the K. and M.<br />
  For you? Nay, Kate, look down amid the globes<br />
  Of those large lilies that our light canoe<br />
  Divides, and see within the polish'd pool<br />
  That small, rose face of yours,&mdash;so dear, so fair,&mdash;<br />
  A seed of love to cleave into a rock,<br />
  And bourgeon thence until the granite splits<br />
  Before its subtle strength. I being gone&mdash;<br />
  Poor soldier of the axe&mdash;to bloodless fields,<br />
  (Inglorious battles, whether lost or won).<br />
  That sixteen summer'd heart of yours may say:<br />
  "'I but was budding, and I did not know<br />
  My core was crimson and my perfume sweet;<br />
  I did not know how choice a thing I am;<br />
  I had not seen the sun, and blind I sway'd<br />
  To a strong wind, and thought because I sway'd,<br />
  'Twas to the wooer of the perfect rose&mdash;<br />
  That strong, wild wind has swept beyond my ken&mdash;<br />
  The breeze I love sighs thro' my ruddy leaves."<br />
  "O, words!" said Katie, blushing, "only words!<br />
  You build them up that I may push them down;<br />
  If hearts are flow'rs, I know that flow'rs can root&mdash;<br />
  "Bud, blossom, die&mdash;all in the same lov'd soil;<br />
  They do so in my garden. I have made<br />
  Your heart my garden. If I am a bud<br />
  And only feel unfoldment&mdash;feebly stir<br />
  Within my leaves: wait patiently; some June,<br />
  I'll blush a full-blown rose, and queen it, dear,<br />
  In your lov'd garden. Tho' I be a bud,<br />
  My roots strike deep, and torn from that dear soil<br />
  Would shriek like mandrakes&mdash;those witch things I read<br />
  Of in your quaint old books. Are you content?"<br />
  "Yes&mdash;crescent-wise&mdash;but not to round, full moon.<br />
  Look at yon hill that rounds so gently up<br />
  From the wide lake; a lover king it looks,<br />
  In cloth of gold, gone from his bride and queen;<br />
  And yet delayed, because her silver locks<br />
  Catch in his gilded fringes; his shoulders sweep<br />
  Into blue distance, and his gracious crest,<br />
  Not held too high, is plum'd with maple groves;&mdash;<br />
  One of your father's farms. A mighty man,<br />
  Self-hewn from rock, remaining rock through all."<br />
  "He loves me, Max," said Katie: "Yes, I know&mdash;<br />
  A rock is cup to many a crystal spring.<br />
  Well, he is rich; those misty, peak-roof'd barns&mdash;<br />
  Leviathans rising from red seas of grain&mdash;<br />
  Are full of ingots, shaped like grains of wheat.<br />
  His flocks have golden fleeces, and his herds<br />
  Have monarchs worshipful, as was the calf<br />
  Aaron call'd from the furnace; and his ploughs,<br />
  Like Genii chained, snort o'er his mighty fields.<br />
  He has a voice in Council and in Church&mdash;"<br />
  "He work'd for all," said Katie, somewhat pain'd.<br />
  "Aye, so, dear love, he did; I heard him tell<br />
  How the first field upon his farm was ploughed.<br />
  He and his brother Reuben, stalwart lads,<br />
  Yok'd themselves, side by side, to the new plough;<br />
  Their weaker father, in the grey of life<br />
  (But rather the wan age of poverty<br />
  Than many winters), in large, gnarl'd hands<br />
  The plunging handles held; with mighty strains<br />
  They drew the ripping beak through knotted sod,<br />
  Thro' tortuous lanes of blacken'd, smoking stumps;<br />
  And past great flaming brush heaps, sending out<br />
  Fierce summers, beating on their swollen brows.<br />
  O, such a battle! had we heard of serfs<br />
  Driven to like hot conflict with the soil,<br />
  Armies had march'd and navies swiftly sail'd<br />
  To burst their gyves. But here's the little point&mdash;<br />
  The polish'd di'mond pivot on which spins<br />
  The wheel of Difference&mdash;they OWN'D the rugged soil,<br />
  And fought for love&mdash;dear love of wealth and pow'r,<br />
  And honest ease and fair esteem of men;<br />
  One's blood heats at it!" "Yet you said such fields<br />
  Were all inglorious," Katie, wondering, said.<br />
  "Inglorious? yes; they make no promises<br />
  Of Star or Garter, or the thundering guns<br />
  That tell the earth her warriors are dead.<br />
  Inglorious! aye, the battle done and won<br />
  Means not&mdash;a throne propp'd up with bleaching bones;<br />
  A country sav'd with smoking seas of blood;<br />
  A flag torn from the foe with wounds and death;<br />
  Or Commerce, with her housewife foot upon<br />
  Colossal bridge of slaughter'd savages,<br />
  The Cross laid on her brawny shoulder, and<br />
  In one sly, mighty hand her reeking sword;<br />
  And in the other all the woven cheats<br />
  From her dishonest looms. Nay, none of these.<br />
  It means&mdash;four walls, perhaps a lowly roof;<br />
  Kine in a peaceful posture; modest fields;<br />
  A man and woman standing hand in hand<br />
  In hale old age, who, looking o'er the land,<br />
  Say: 'Thank the Lord, it all is mine and thine!'<br />
  It means, to such thew'd warriors of the Axe<br />
  As your own father;&mdash;well, it means, sweet Kate,<br />
  Outspreading circles of increasing gold,<br />
  A name of weight; one little daughter heir.<br />
  Who must not wed the owner of an axe,<br />
  Who owns naught else but some dim, dusky woods<br />
  In a far land; two arms indifferent strong&mdash;"<br />
  "And Katie's heart," said Katie, with a smile;<br />
  For yet she stood on that smooth, violet plain,<br />
  Where nothing shades the sun; nor quite believed<br />
  Those blue peaks closing in were aught but mist<br />
  Which the gay sun could scatter with a glance.<br />
  For Max, he late had touch'd their stones, but yet<br />
  He saw them seam'd with gold and precious ores,<br />
  Rich with hill flow'rs and musical with rills.<br />
  "Or that same bud that will be Katie's heart,<br />
  Against the time your deep, dim woods are clear'd,<br />
  And I have wrought my father to relent."<br />
  "How will you move him, sweet? why, he will rage<br />
  And fume and anger, striding o'er his fields,<br />
  Until the last bought king of herds lets down<br />
  His lordly front, and rumbling thunder from<br />
  His polish'd chest, returns his chiding tones.<br />
  How will you move him, Katie, tell me how?"<br />
  "I'll kiss him and keep still&mdash;that way is sure,"<br />
  Said Katie, smiling. "I have often tried."<br />
  "God speed the kiss," said Max, and Katie sigh'd,<br />
  With pray'rful palms close seal'd, "God speed the axe!"<br />

  PART II.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The South Wind laid his moccasins aside,<br />
  Broke his gay calumet of flow'rs, and cast<br />
  His useless wampun, beaded with cool dews,<br />
  Far from him, northward; his long, ruddy spear<br />
  Flung sunward, whence it came, and his soft locks<br />
  Of warm, fine haze grew silver as the birch.<br />
  His wigwam of green leaves began to shake;<br />
  The crackling rice-beds scolded harsh like squaws:<br />
  The small ponds pouted up their silver lips;<br />
  The great lakes ey'd the mountains, whisper'd "Ugh!"<br />
  "Are ye so tall, O chiefs? Not taller than<br />
  Our plumes can reach." And rose a little way,<br />
  As panthers stretch to try their velvet limbs,<br />
  And then retreat to purr and bide their time.<br />
  At morn the sharp breath of the night arose<br />
  From the wide prairies, in deep struggling seas,<br />
  In rolling breakers, bursting to the sky;<br />
  In tumbling surfs, all yellow'd faintly thro'<br />
  With the low sun&mdash;in mad, conflicting crests,<br />
  Voic'd with low thunder from the hairy throats<br />
  Of the mist-buried herds; and for a man<br />
  To stand amid the cloudy roll and moil,<br />
  The phantom waters breaking overhead,<br />
  Shades of vex'd billows bursting on his breast,<br />
  Torn caves of mist wall'd with a sudden gold,<br />
  Reseal'd as swift as seen&mdash;broad, shaggy fronts,<br />
  Fire-ey'd and tossing on impatient horns<br />
  The wave impalpable&mdash;was but to think<br />
  A dream of phantoms held him as he stood.<br />
  The late, last thunders of the summer crash'd,<br />
  Where shrieked great eagles, lords of naked cliffs.<br />
  The pulseless forest, lock'd and interlock'd<br />
  So closely, bough with bough, and leaf with leaf,<br />
  So serf'd by its own wealth, that while from high<br />
  The moons of summer kiss'd its green-gloss'd locks;<br />
  And round its knees the merry West Wind danc'd;<br />
  And round its ring, compacted emerald;<br />
  The south wind crept on moccasins of flame;<br />
  And the fed fingers of th' impatient sun<br />
  Pluck'd at its outmost fringes&mdash;its dim veins<br />
  Beat with no life&mdash;its deep and dusky heart,<br />
  In a deep trance of shadow, felt no throb<br />
  To such soft wooing answer: thro' its dream<br />
  Brown rivers of deep waters sunless stole;<br />
  Small creeks sprang from its mosses, and amaz'd,<br />
  Like children in a wigwam curtain'd close<br />
  Above the great, dead, heart of some red chief,<br />
  Slipp'd on soft feet, swift stealing through the gloom,<br />
  Eager for light and for the frolic winds.<br />
  In this shrill moon the scouts of winter ran<br />
  From the ice-belted north, and whistling shafts<br />
  Struck maple and struck sumach&mdash;and a blaze<br />
  Ran swift from leaf to leaf, from bough to bough;<br />
  Till round the forest flash'd a belt of flame.<br />
  And inward lick'd its tongues of red and gold<br />
  To the deep, tranied inmost heart of all.<br />
  Rous'd the still heart&mdash;but all too late, too late.<br />
  Too late, the branches welded fast with leaves,<br />
  Toss'd, loosen'd, to the winds&mdash;too late the sun<br />
  Pour'd his last vigor to the deep, dark cells<br />
  Of the dim wood. The keen, two-bladed Moon<br />
  Of Falling Leaves roll'd up on crested mists<br />
  And where the lush, rank boughs had foiled the sun<br />
  In his red prime, her pale, sharp fingers crept<br />
  After the wind and felt about the moss,<br />
  And seem'd to pluck from shrinking twig and stem<br />
  The burning leaves&mdash;while groan'd the shudd'ring wood.<br />
  Who journey'd where the prairies made a pause,<br />
  Saw burnish'd ramparts flaming in the sun,<br />
  With beacon fires, tall on their rustling walls.<br />
  And when the vast, horn'd herds at sunset drew<br />
  Their sullen masses into one black cloud,<br />
  Rolling thund'rous o'er the quick pulsating plain,<br />
  They seem'd to sweep between two fierce red suns<br />
  Which, hunter-wise, shot at their glaring balls<br />
  Keen shafts, with scarlet feathers and gold barbs,<br />
  By round, small lakes with thinner, forests fring'd,<br />
  More jocund woods that sung about the feet<br />
  And crept along the shoulders of great cliffs;<br />
  The warrior stags, with does and tripping fawns,<br />
  Like shadows black upon the throbbing mist<br />
  Of Evening's rose, flash'd thro' the singing woods&mdash;<br />
  Nor tim'rous, sniff'd the spicy, cone-breath'd air;<br />
  For never had the patriarch of the herd<br />
  Seen limn'd against the farthest rim of light<br />
  Of the low-dipping sky, the plume or bow<br />
  Of the red hunter; nor when stoop'd to drink,<br />
  Had from the rustling rice-beds heard the shaft<br />
  Of the still hunter hidden in its spears;<br />
  His bark canoe close-knotted in its bronze,<br />
  His form as stirless as the brooding air,<br />
  His dusky eyes too, fix'd, unwinking, fires;<br />
  His bow-string tighten'd till it subtly sang<br />
  To the long throbs, and leaping pulse that roll'd<br />
  And beat within his knotted, naked breast.<br />
  There came a morn. The Moon of Falling Leaves,<br />
  With her twin silver blades had only hung<br />
  Above the low set cedars of the swamp<br />
  For one brief quarter, when the sun arose<br />
  Lusty with light and full of summer heat,<br />
  And pointing with his arrows at the blue,<br />
  Clos'd wigwam curtains of the sleeping moon,<br />
  Laugh'd with the noise of arching cataracts,<br />
  And with the dove-like cooing of the woods,<br />
  And with the shrill cry of the diving loon<br />
  And with the wash of saltless, rounded seas,<br />
  And mock'd the white moon of the Falling Leaves.<br />
  "Esa! esa! shame upon you, Pale Face!<br />
  "Shame upon you, moon of evil witches!<br />
  "Have you kill'd the happy, laughing Summer?<br />
  "Have you slain the mother of the Flowers<br />
  "With your icy spells of might and magic?<br />
  "Have you laid her dead within my arms?<br />
  "Wrapp'd her, mocking, in a rainbow blanket.<br />
  "Drown'd her in the frost mist of your anger?<br />
  "She is gone a little way before me;<br />
  "Gone an arrow's flight beyond my vision;<br />
  "She will turn again and come to meet me,<br />
  "With the ghosts of all the slain flowers,<br />
  "In a blue mist round her shining tresses;<br />
  "In a blue smoke in her naked forests&mdash;<br />
  "She will linger, kissing all the branches,<br />
  "She will linger, touching all the places,<br />
  "Bare and naked, with her golden fingers,<br />
  "Saying, 'Sleep, and dream of me, my children<br />
  "'Dream of me, the mystic Indian Summer;<br />
  "'I, who, slain by the cold Moon of Terror,<br />
  "'Can return across the path of Spirits,<br />
  "'Bearing still my heart of love and fire;<br />
  "'Looking with my eyes of warmth and splendour;<br />
  "'Whisp'ring lowly thro' your sleep of sunshine?<br />
  "'I, the laughing Summer, am not turn'd<br />
  "'Into dry dust, whirling on the prairies,&mdash;<br />
  "'Into red clay, crush'd beneath the snowdrifts.<br />
  "'I am still the mother of sweet flowers<br />
  "'Growing but an arrow's flight beyond you&mdash;<br />
  "'In the Happy Hunting Ground&mdash;the quiver<br />
  "'Of great Manitou, where all the arrows<br />
  "'He has shot from his great bow of Pow'r,<br />
  "'With its clear, bright, singing cord of Wisdom,<br />
  "'Are re-gather'd, plum'd again and brighten'd,<br />
  "'And shot out, re-barb'd with Love and Wisdom;<br />
  "'Always shot, and evermore returning.<br />
  "'Sleep, my children, smiling in your heart-seeds<br />
  "'At the spirit words of Indian Summer!'"<br />
  "Thus, O Moon of Falling Leaves, I mock you!<br />
  "Have you slain my gold-ey'd squaw, the Summer?"<br />
  The mighty morn strode laughing up the land,<br />
  And Max, the labourer and the lover, stood<br />
  Within the forest's edge, beside a tree;<br />
  The mossy king of all the woody tribes,<br />
  Whose clatt'ring branches rattl'd, shuddering,<br />
  As the bright axe cleav'd moon-like thro' the air,<br />
  Waking strange thunders, rousing echoes link'd<br />
  From the full, lion-throated roar, to sighs<br />
  Stealing on dove-wings thro' the distant aisles.<br />
  Swift fell the axe, swift follow'd roar on roar,<br />
  Till the bare woodland bellow'd in its rage,<br />
  As the first-slain slow toppl'd to his fall.<br />
  "O King of Desolation, art thou dead?"<br />
  Thought Max, and laughing, heart and lips, leap'd on<br />
  The vast, prone trunk. "And have I slain a King?<br />
  "Above his ashes will I build my house&mdash;<br />
  No slave beneath its pillars, but&mdash;a King!"<br />
  Max wrought alone, but for a half-breed lad,<br />
  With tough, lithe sinews and deep Indian eyes,<br />
  Lit with a Gallic sparkle. Max, the lover, found<br />
  The labourer's arms grow mightier day by day&mdash;<br />
  More iron-welded as he slew the trees;<br />
  And with the constant yearning of his heart<br />
  Towards little Kate, part of a world away,<br />
  His young soul grew and shew'd a virile front,<br />
  Full-muscl'd and large statur'd, like his flesh.<br />
  Soon the great heaps of brush were builded high,<br />
  And like a victor, Max made pause to clear<br />
  His battle-field, high strewn with tangl'd dead.<br />
  Then roar'd the crackling mountains, and their fires<br />
  Met in high heaven, clasping flame with flame.<br />
  The thin winds swept a cosmos of red sparks<br />
  Across the bleak, midnight sky; and the sun<br />
  Walk'd pale behind the resinous, black smoke.<br />
  And Max car'd little for the blotted sun,<br />
  And nothing for the startl'd, outshone stars;<br />
  For Love, once set within a lover's breast,<br />
  Has its own Sun&mdash;it's own peculiar sky,<br />
  All one great daffodil&mdash;on which do lie<br />
  The sun, the moon, the stars&mdash;all seen at once,<br />
  And never setting; but all shining straight<br />
  Into the faces of the trinity,&mdash;<br />
  The one belov'd, the lover, and sweet Love!<br />
  It was not all his own, the axe-stirr'd waste.<br />
  In these new days men spread about the earth,<br />
  With wings at heel&mdash;and now the settler hears,<br />
  While yet his axe rings on the primal woods,<br />
  The shrieks of engines rushing o'er the wastes;<br />
  Nor parts his kind to hew his fortunes out.<br />
  And as one drop glides down the unknown rock<br />
  And the bright-threaded stream leaps after it,<br />
  With welded billions, so the settler finds<br />
  His solitary footsteps beaten out,<br />
  With the quick rush of panting, human waves<br />
  Upheav'd by throbs of angry poverty;<br />
  And driven by keen blasts of hunger, from<br />
  Their native strands&mdash;so stern, so dark, so dear!<br />
  O, then, to see the troubl'd, groaning waves,<br />
  Throb down to peace in kindly, valley beds;<br />
  Their turbid bosoms clearing in the calm<br />
  Of sun-ey'd Plenty&mdash;till the stars and moon,<br />
  The blessed sun himself, has leave to shine<br />
  And laugh in their dark hearts! So shanties grew<br />
  Other than his amid the blacken'd stumps;<br />
  And children ran, with little twigs and leaves<br />
  And flung them, shouting, on the forest pyres,<br />
  Where burn'd the forest kings&mdash;and in the glow<br />
  Paus'd men and women when the day was done.<br />
  There the lean weaver ground anew his axe,<br />
  Nor backward look'd upon the vanish'd loom,<br />
  But forward to the ploughing of his fields;<br />
  And to the rose of Plenty in the cheeks.<br />
  Of wife and children&mdash;nor heeded much the pangs<br />
  Of the rous'd muscles tuning to new work.<br />
  The pallid clerk look'd on his blister'd palms<br />
  And sigh'd and smil'd, but girded up his loins<br />
  And found new vigour as he felt new hope.<br />
  The lab'rer with train'd muscles, grim and grave,<br />
  Look'd at the ground and wonder'd in his soul,<br />
  What joyous anguish stirr'd his darken'd heart,<br />
  At the mere look of the familiar soil,<br />
  And found his answer in the words&mdash;"<i>Mine own!</i>"<br />
  Then came smooth-coated men, with eager eyes,<br />
  And talk'd of steamers on the cliff-bound lakes;<br />
  And iron tracks across the prairie lands;<br />
  And mills to crush the quartz of wealthy hills;<br />
  And mills to saw the great, wide-arm'd trees;<br />
  And mills to grind the singing stream of grain;<br />
  And with such busy clamour mingled still<br />
  The throbbing music of the bold, bright Axe&mdash;<br />
  The steel tongue of the Present, and the wail<br />
  Of falling forests&mdash;voices of the Past.<br />
  Max, social-soul'd, and with his practised thews,<br />
  Was happy, boy-like, thinking much of Kate,<br />
  And speaking of her to the women-folk;<br />
  Who, mostly, happy in new honeymoons<br />
  Of hope themselves, were ready still to hear<br />
  The thrice told tale of Katie's sunny eyes<br />
  And Katie's yellow hair, and household ways:<br />
  And heard so often, "There shall stand our home&mdash;<br />
  "On yonder slope, with vines about the door!"<br />
  That the good wives were almost made to see<br />
  The snowy walls, deep porches, and the gleam<br />
  Of Katie's garments flitting through the rooms;<br />
  And the black slope all bristling with burn'd stumps<br />
  Was known amongst them all as "Max's House."<br />

  PART III.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The great farm house of Malcolm Graem stood<br />
  Square shoulder'd and peak roof'd upon a hill,<br />
  With many windows looking everywhere;<br />
  So that no distant meadow might lie hid,<br />
  Nor corn-field hide its gold&mdash;nor lowing herd<br />
  Browse in far pastures, out of Malcolm's ken.<br />
  He lov'd to sit, grim, grey, and somewhat stern,<br />
  And thro' the smoke-clouds from his short clay pipe<br />
  Look out upon his riches; while his thoughts<br />
  Swung back and forth between the bleak, stern past,<br />
  And the near future, for his life had come<br />
  To that close balance, when, a pendulum,<br />
  The memory swings between me "Then" and "Now";<br />
  His seldom speech ran thus two diff'rent ways:<br />
  "When I was but a laddie, this I did";<br />
  Or, "Katie, in the Fall I'll see to build<br />
  "Such fences or such sheds about the place;<br />
  "And next year, please the Lord, another barn."<br />
  Katie's gay garden foam'd about the walls,<br />
  'Leagur'd the prim-cut modern sills, and rush'd<br />
  Up the stone walls&mdash;and broke on the peak'd roof.<br />
  And Katie's lawn was like a Poet's sward,<br />
  Velvet and sheer and di'monded with dew;<br />
  For such as win their wealth most aptly take<br />
  Smooth, urban ways and blend them with their own;<br />
  And Katie's dainty raiment was as fine<br />
  As the smooth, silken petals of the rose;<br />
  And her light feet, her nimble mind and voice,<br />
  In city schools had learn'd the city's ways,<br />
  And grafts upon the healthy, lonely vine<br />
  They shone, eternal blossoms 'mid the fruit.<br />
  For Katie had her sceptre in her hand<br />
  And wielded it right queenly there and here,<br />
  In dairy, store-room, kitchen&mdash;ev'ry spot<br />
  Where women's ways were needed on the place.<br />
  And Malcolm took her through his mighty fields,<br />
  And taught her lore about the change of crops;<br />
  And how to see a handsome furrow plough'd;<br />
  And how to choose the cattle for the mart;<br />
  And how to know a fair day's work when done;<br />
  And where to plant young orchards; for he said,<br />
  "God sent a lassie, but I need a son&mdash;<br />
  "Bethankit for His mercies all the same."<br />
  And Katie, when he said it, thought of Max&mdash;<br />
  Who had been gone two winters and two springs,<br />
  And sigh'd, and thought, "Would he not be your son?"<br />
  But all in silence, for she had too much<br />
  Of the firm will of Malcolm in her soul<br />
  To think of shaking that deep-rooted rock;<br />
  But hop'd the crystal current of his love<br />
  For his one child, increasing day by day,<br />
  Might fret with silver lip, until it wore<br />
  Such channels thro' the rock, that some slight stroke<br />
  Of circumstance might crumble down the stone.<br />
  The wooer, too, had come, Max prophesied;<br />
  Reputed wealthy; with the azure eyes<br />
  And Saxon-gilded locks&mdash;the fair, clear face,<br />
  And stalwart form that most women love.<br />
  And with the jewels of some virtues set<br />
  On his broad brow. With fires within his soul<br />
  He had the wizard skill to fetter down<br />
  To that mere pink, poetic, nameless glow,<br />
  That need not fright a flake of snow away&mdash;<br />
  But if unloos'd, could melt an adverse rock<br />
  Marrow'd with iron, frowning in his way.<br />
  And Malcolm balanc'd him by day and night;<br />
  And with his grey-ey'd shrewdness partly saw<br />
  He was not one for Kate; but let him come,<br />
  And in chance moments thought: "Well, let it be&mdash;<br />
  "They make a bonnie pair&mdash;he knows the ways<br />
  "Of men and things: can hold the gear I give,<br />
  "And, if the lassie wills it, let it be."<br />
  And then, upstarting from his midnight sleep,<br />
  With hair erect and sweat upon his brow,<br />
  Such as no labor e'er had beaded there;<br />
  Would cry aloud, wide-staring thro' the dark&mdash;<br />
  "Nay, nay; she shall not wed him&mdash;rest in peace."<br />
  Then fully waking, grimly laugh and say:<br />
  "Why did I speak and answer when none spake?"<br />
  But still lie staring, wakeful, through the shades;<br />
  List'ning to the silence, and beating still<br />
  The ball of Alfred's merits to and fro&mdash;<br />
  Saying, between the silent arguments:<br />
  "But would the mother like it, could she know?<br />
  "I would there was a way to ring a lad<br />
  "Like silver coin, and so find out the true;<br />
  "But Kate shall say him 'Nay' or say him 'Yea'<br />
  "At her own will." And Katie said him "Nay,"<br />
  In all the maiden, speechless, gentle ways<br />
  A woman has. But Alfred only laugh'd<br />
  To his own soul, and said in his wall'd mind:<br />
  "O, Kate, were I a lover, I might feel<br />
  "Despair flap o'er my hopes with raven wings;<br />
  "Because thy love is giv'n to other love.<br />
  "And did I love&mdash;unless I gain'd thy love,<br />
  "I would disdain the golden hair, sweet lips,<br />
  "Air-blown form and true violet eyes;<br />
  "Nor crave the beauteous lamp without the flame;<br />
  "Which in itself would light a charnel house.<br />
  "Unlov'd and loving, I would find the cure<br />
  "Of Love's despair in nursing Love's disdain&mdash;<br />
  "Disdain of lesser treasure than the whole.<br />
  "One cares not much to place against the wheel<br />
  "A diamond lacking flame&mdash;nor loves to pluck<br />
  "A rose with all its perfume cast abroad<br />
  "To the bosom of the gale. Not I, in truth!<br />
  "If all man's days are three score years and ten,<br />
  "He needs must waste them not, but nimbly seize<br />
  "The bright consummate blossom that his will<br />
  "Calls for most loudly. Gone, long gone the days<br />
  "When Love within my soul for ever stretch'd<br />
  "Fierce hands of flame, and here and there I found<br />
  "A blossom fitted for him&mdash;all up-fill'd<br />
  "With love as with clear dew&mdash;they had their hour<br />
  "And burn'd to ashes with him, as he droop'd<br />
  "In his own ruby fires. No Phoenix he,<br />
  "To rise again because of Katie's eyes,<br />
  "On dewy wings, from ashes such as his!<br />
  "But now, another Passion bids me forth.<br />
  "To crown him with the fairest I can find,<br />
  "And makes me lover&mdash;not of Katie's face,<br />
  "But of her father's riches! O, high fool,<br />
  "Who feels the faintest pulsing of a wish<br />
  "And fails to feed it into lordly life!<br />
  "So that, when stumbling back to Mother Earth,<br />
  "His freezing lip may curl in cold disdain<br />
  "Of those poor, blighted fools who starward stare<br />
  "For that fruition, nipp'd and scanted here.<br />
  "And, while the clay, o'ermasters all his blood&mdash;<br />
  "And he can feel the dust knit with his flesh&mdash;<br />
  "He yet can say to them, 'Be ye content;<br />
  "'I tasted perfect fruitage thro' my life,<br />
  "'Lighted all lamps of passion, till the oil<br />
  "'Fail'd from their wicks; and now, O now, I know<br />
  "'There is no Immortality could give<br />
  "'Such boon as this&mdash;to simply cease to be!<br />
  "'<i>There</i> lies your Heaven, O ye dreaming slaves,<br />
  "'If ye would only live to make it so;<br />
  "'Nor paint upon the blue skies lying shades<br />
  "'Of&mdash;<i>what is not</i>. Wise, wise and strong the man<br />
  "'who poisons that fond haunter of the mind,<br />
  "'Craving for a hereafter with deep draughts<br />
  "'Of wild delights&mdash;so fiery, fierce, and strong,<br />
  "'That when their dregs are deeply, deeply drain'd,<br />
  "'What once was blindly crav'd of purblind Chance,<br />
  "'Life, life eternal&mdash;throbbing thro' all space<br />
  "'Is strongly loath'd&mdash;and with his face in dust,<br />
  "'Man loves his only Heav'n&mdash;six feet of Earth!'<br />
  "So, Katie, tho' your blue eyes say me 'Nay,'<br />
  "My pangs of love for gold must needs be fed,<br />
  "And shall be, Katie, if I know my mind."<br />
  Events were winds close nest'ling in the sails<br />
  Of Alfred's bark, all blowing him direct<br />
  To his wish'd harbour. On a certain day,<br />
  All set about with roses and with fire;<br />
  One of three days of heat which frequent slip,<br />
  Like triple rubies, in between the sweet,<br />
  Mild, emerald days of summer, Katie went,<br />
  Drawn by a yearning for the ice-pale blooms,<br />
  Natant and shining&mdash;firing all the bay<br />
  With angel fires built up of snow and gold.<br />
  She found the bay close pack'd with groaning logs,<br />
  Prison'd between great arms of close hing'd wood.<br />
  All cut from Malcolm's forests in the west,<br />
  And floated hither to his noisy mills;<br />
  And all stamp'd with the potent "G." and "M.,"<br />
  Which much he lov'd to see upon his goods,<br />
  The silent courtiers owning him their king.<br />
  Out clear beyond the rustling ricebeds sang,<br />
  And the cool lilies starr'd the shadow'd wave.<br />
  "This is a day for lily-love," said Kate,<br />
  While she made bare the lilies of her feet;<br />
  And sang a lily song that Max had made,<br />
  That spoke of lilies&mdash;always meaning Kate.<br />

<p class="poem">
  Kate bared her little feet, and pois'd herself<br />
  On the first log close grating on the shore;<br />
  And with bright eyes of laughter, and wild hair&mdash;<br />
  A flying wind of gold&mdash;from log to log<br />
  Sped, laughing as they wallow'd in her track,<br />
  Like brown-scal'd monsters rolling, as her foot<br />
  Spurn'd each in turn with its rose-white sole.<br />
  A little island, out in middlewave,<br />
  With its green shoulder held the great drive brac'd<br />
  Between it and the mainland; here it was<br />
  The silver lilies drew her with white smiles;<br />
  And as she touch'd the last great log of all,<br />
  It reel'd, upstarting, like a column brac'd,<br />
  A second on the wave&mdash;and when it plung'd<br />
  Rolling upon the froth and sudden foam,<br />
  Katie had vanish'd, and with angry grind<br />
  The vast logs roll'd together,&mdash;nor a lock<br />
  Of drifting yellow hair&mdash;an upflung hand,<br />
  Told where the rich man's chiefest treasure sank<br />
  Under his wooden wealth. But Alfred, laid<br />
  With pipe and book upon the shady marge,<br />
  Of the cool isle, saw all, and seeing hurl'd<br />
  Himself, and hardly knew it, on the logs;<br />
  By happy chance a shallow lapp'd the isle<br />
  On this green bank; and when his iron arms<br />
  Dash'd the bark'd monsters, as frail stems of rice,<br />
  A little space apart, the soft, slow tide<br />
  But reach'd his chest, and in a flash he saw<br />
  Kate's yellow hair, and by it drew her up,<br />
  And lifting her aloft, cried out, "O, Kate!"<br />
  And once again said, "Katie! is she dead?"<br />
  For like the lilies broken by the rough<br />
  And sudden riot of the armor'd logs,<br />
  Kate lay upon his hands; and now the logs<br />
  Clos'd in upon him, nipping his great chest,<br />
  Nor could he move to push them off again<br />
  For Katie in his arms. "And now," he said,<br />
  "If none should come, and any wind arise<br />
  "To weld these woody monsters 'gainst the isle,<br />
  "I shall be crack'd like any broken twig;<br />
  "And as it is, I know not if I die,<br />
  "For I am hurt&mdash;aye, sorely, sorely hurt!"<br />
  Then look'd on Katie's lily face, and said,<br />
  "Dead, dead or living? Why, an even chance.<br />
  "O lovely bubble on a troubl'd sea,<br />
  "I would not thou shoulds't lose thyself again<br />
  "In the black ocean whence thy life emerg'd,<br />
  "But skyward steal on gales as soft as love,<br />
  "And hang in some bright rainbow overhead,<br />
  "If only such bright rainbow spann'd the earth."<br />
  Then shouted loudly, till the silent air<br />
  Rous'd like a frighten'd bird, and on its wings<br />
  Caught up his cry and bore it to the farm.<br />
  There Malcolm, leaping from his noontide sleep,<br />
  Upstarted as at midnight, crying out,<br />
  "She shall not wed him&mdash;rest you, wife, in peace!'<br />
  They found him, Alfred, haggard-ey'd and faint,<br />
  But holding Katie ever towards the sun,<br />
  Unhurt, and waking in the fervent heat.<br />
  And now it came that Alfred being sick<br />
  Of his sharp hurts and tended by them both,<br />
  With what was like to love, being born of thanks,<br />
  Had choice of hours most politic to woo,<br />
  And used his deed as one might use the sun,<br />
  To ripen unmellow'd fruit; and from the core<br />
  Of Katie's gratitude hop'd yet to nurse<br />
  A flow'r all to his liking&mdash;Katie's love.<br />
  But Katie's mind was like the plain, broad shield<br />
  Of a table di'mond, nor had a score of sides;<br />
  And in its shield, so precious and so plain,<br />
  Was cut, thro' all its clear depths&mdash;Max's name!<br />
  And so she said him "Nay" at last, in words<br />
  Of such true sounding silver, that he knew<br />
  He might not win her at the present hour,<br />
  But smil'd and thought&mdash;"I go, and come again!<br />
  "Then shall we see. Our three-score years and ten<br />
  "Are mines of treasure, if we hew them deep,<br />
  "Nor stop too long in choosing out our tools!"<br />

  From his far wigwam sprang the strong North Wind<br />

  Max smote the snow-weigh'd tree and lightly laugh'd.<br />
  "See, friend," he cried to one that look'd and smil'd,<br />
  "My axe and I&mdash;we do immortal tasks&mdash;<br />
  We build up nations&mdash;this my axe and I!"<br />
  "O," said the other with a cold, short smile,<br />
  "Nations are not immortal! is there now<br />
  "One nation thron'd upon the sphere of earth,<br />
  "That walk'd with the first Gods, and saw<br />
  "The budding world unfold its slow-leav'd flow'r?<br />
  "Nay; it is hardly theirs to leave behind<br />
  "Ruins so eloquent, that the hoary sage<br />
  "Can lay his hand upon their stones, and say:<br />
  "'These once were thrones!' The lean, lank lion peals<br />
  "His midnight thunders over lone, red plains,<br />
  "Long-ridg'd and crested on their dusty waves,<br />
  "With fires from moons red-hearted as the sun;<br />
  "And deep re-thunders all the earth to him.<br />
  "For, far beneath the flame-fleck'd, shifting sands,<br />
  "Below the roots of palms, and under stones<br />
  "Of younger ruins, thrones, tow'rs and cities<br />
  "Honeycomb the earth. The high, solemn walls<br />
  "Of hoary ruins&mdash;their foundings all unknown<br />
  "(But to the round-ey'd worlds that walk<br />
  "In the blank paths of Space and blanker Chance).<br />
  "At whose stones young mountains wonder, and the seas'<br />
  "New-silv'ring, deep-set valleys pause and gaze;<br />
  "Are rear'd upon old shrines, whose very Gods<br />
  "Were dreams to the shrine-builders, of a time<br />
  "They caught in far-off flashes&mdash;as the child<br />
  "Half thinks he can remember how one came<br />
  "And took him in her hand and shew'd him that<br />
  "He thinks, she call'd the sun. Proud ships rear high<br />
  "On ancient billows that have torn the roots<br />
  "Of cliffs, and bitten at the golden lips<br />
  "Of firm, sleek beaches, till they conquer'd all,<br />
  "And sow'd the reeling earth with salted waves.<br />
  "Wrecks plunge, prow foremost, down still, solemn slopes,<br />
  "And bring their dead crews to as dead a quay;<br />
  "Some city built before that ocean grew,<br />
  "By silver drops from many a floating cloud,<br />
  "By icebergs bellowing in their throes of death,<br />
  "By lesser seas toss'd from their rocking cups,<br />
  "And leaping each to each; by dew-drops flung<br />
  "From painted sprays, whose weird leaves and flow'rs<br />
  "Are moulded for new dwellers on the earth,<br />
  "Printed in hearts of mountains and of mines.<br />
  "Nations immortal? where the well-trimm'd lamps<br />
  "Of long-past ages, when Time seem'd to pause<br />
  "On smooth, dust-blotted graves that, like the tombs<br />
  "Of monarchs, held dead bones and sparkling gems?<br />
  "She saw no glimmer on the hideous ring<br />
  "Of the black clouds; no stream of sharp, clear light<br />
  "From those great torches, pass'd into the black<br />
  "Of deep oblivion. She seem'd to watch, but she<br />
  "Forgot her long-dead nations. When she stirr'd<br />
  "Her vast limbs in the dawn that forc'd its fire<br />
  "Up the black East, and saw the imperious red<br />
  "Burst over virgin dews and budding flow'rs,<br />
  "She still forgot her molder'd thrones and kings,<br />
  "Her sages and their torches, and their Gods,<br />
  "And said, 'This is my birth&mdash;my primal day!'<br />
  "She dream'd new Gods, and rear'd them other shrines,<br />
  "Planted young nations, smote a feeble flame<br />
  "From sunless flint, re-lit the torch of mind;<br />
  "Again she hung her cities on the hills,<br />
  "Built her rich towers, crown'd her kings again,<br />
  "And with the sunlight on her awful wings<br />
  "Swept round the flow'ry cestus of the earth,<br />
  "And said, 'I build for Immortality!'<br />
  "Her vast hand rear'd her tow'rs, her shrines, her thrones;<br />
  "The ceaseless sweep of her tremendous wings<br />
  "Still beat them down and swept their dust abroad;<br />
  "Her iron finger wrote on mountain sides<br />
  "Her deeds and prowess&mdash;and her own soft plume<br />
  "Wore down the hills! Again drew darkly on<br />
  "A night of deep forgetfulness; once more<br />
  "Time seem'd to pause upon forgotten graves&mdash;<br />
  "Once more a young dawn stole into her eyes&mdash;<br />
  "Again her broad wings stirr'd, and fresh clear airs,<br />
  "Blew the great clouds apart;&mdash;again Time said,<br />
  "'This is my birth&mdash;my deeds and handiwork<br />
  "'Shall be immortal.' Thus and so dream on<br />
  "Fool'd nations, and thus dream their dullard sons.<br />
  "Naught is immortal save immortal&mdash;Death!"<br />
  Max paus'd and smil'd: "O, preach such gospel, friend,<br />
  "To all but lovers who most truly love;<br />
  "For <i>them</i>, their gold-wrought scripture glibly reads<br />
  "All else is mortal but immortal&mdash;Love!"<br />
  "Fools! fools!" his friend said, "most immortal fools!&mdash;<br />
  "But pardon, pardon, for, perchance, you love?"<br />
  "Yes," said Max, proudly smiling, "thus do I<br />
  "Possess the world and feel eternity!"<br />
  Dark laughter blacken'd in the other's eyes:<br />
  "Eternity! why, did such Iris arch<br />
  "Ent'ring our worm-bored planet, never liv'd<br />
  "One woman true enough such tryst to keep!"<br />
  "I'd swear by Kate," said Max; "and then, I had<br />
  "A mother, and my father swore by her."<br />
  "By Kate? Ah, that were lusty oath, indeed!<br />
  "Some other man will look into her eyes,<br />
  "And swear me roundly, 'By true Catherine!'<br />
  "And Troilus swore by Cressed&mdash;so they say."<br />
  "You never knew my Kate," said Max, and pois'd<br />
  His axe again on high, "But let it pass&mdash;<br />
  "You are too subtle for me; argument<br />
  "Have I none to oppose yours with&mdash;but this,<br />
  "Get you a Kate, and let her sunny eyes<br />
  "Dispel the doubting darkness in your soul."<br />
  "And have not I a Kate? pause, friend, and see.<br />
  "She gave me this faint shadow of herself<br />
  "The day I slipp'd the watch-star of our loves&mdash;<br />
  "A ring&mdash;upon her hand&mdash;she loves me, too;<br />
  "Yet tho' her eyes be suns, no Gods are they<br />
  "To give me worlds, or make me feel a tide<br />
  "Of strong Eternity set towards my soul;<br />
  "And tho' she loves me, yet am I content<br />
  "To know she loves me by the hour&mdash;the year&mdash;<br />
  "Perchance the second&mdash;as all women love."<br />
  The bright axe falter'd in the air, and ripp'd<br />
  Down the rough bark, and bit the drifted snow,<br />
  For Max's arm fell, wither'd in its strength,<br />
  'Long by his side. "Your Kate," he said; "your Kate!"<br />
  "Yes, mine, while holds her mind that way, my Kate;<br />
  "I sav'd her life, and had her love for thanks;<br />
  "Her father is Malcolm Graem&mdash;Max, my friend,<br />
  "You pale! what sickness seizes on your soul?"<br />
  Max laugh'd, and swung his bright axe high again:<br />
  "Stand back a pace&mdash;a too far reaching blow<br />
  "Might level your false head with yon prone trunk&mdash;<br />
  "Stand back and listen while I say, "You lie!<br />
  "That is my Katie's face upon your breast,<br />
  "But 'tis my Katie's love lives in my breast&mdash;<br />
  "Stand back, I say! my axe is heavy, and<br />
  "Might chance to cleave a liar's brittle skull.<br />
  "Your Kate! your Kate! your Kate!&mdash;hark, how the woods<br />
  "Mock at your lie with all their woody tongues,<br />
  "O, silence, ye false echoes! not his Kate<br />
  "But mine&mdash;I'm certain I will have your life!"<br />
  All the blue heav'n was dead in Max's eyes;<br />
  Doubt-wounded lay Kate's image in his heart,<br />
  And could not rise to pluck the sharp spear out.<br />
  "Well, strike, mad fool," said Alfred, somewhat pale;<br />
  "I have no weapon but these naked hands."<br />
  "Aye, but," said Max, "you smote my naked heart!<br />
  "O shall I slay him?&mdash;Satan, answer me&mdash;<br />
  "I cannot call on God for answer here.<br />
  "O Kate&mdash;!"<br />
  A voice from God came thro' the silent woods<br />
  And answer'd him&mdash;for suddenly a wind<br />
  Caught the great tree-tops, coned with high-pil'd snow,<br />
  And smote them to and fro, while all the air<br />
  Was sudden fill'd with busy drifts, and high<br />
  White pillars whirl'd amid the naked trunks,<br />
  And harsh, loud groans, and smiting, sapless boughs<br />
  Made hellish clamour in the quiet place.<br />
  With a shrill shriek of tearing fibres, rock'd<br />
  The half-hewn tree above his fated head;<br />
  And, tott'ring, asked the sudden blast, "Which way?"<br />
  And, answ'ring its windy arms, crash'd and broke<br />
  Thro' other lacing boughs, with one loud roar<br />
  Of woody thunder; all its pointed boughs<br />
  Pierc'd the deep snow&mdash;its round and mighty corpse,<br />
  Bark-flay'd and shudd'ring, quiver'd into death.<br />
  And Max&mdash;as some frail, wither'd reed, the sharp<br />
  And piercing branches caught at him,<br />
  As hands in a death-throe, and beat him to the earth&mdash;<br />
  And the dead tree upon its slayer lay.<br />
  "Yet hear we much of Gods;&mdash;if such there be,<br />
  "They play at games of chance with thunderbolts,"<br />
  Said Alfred, "else on me this doom had come.<br />
  "This seals my faith in deep and dark unfaith!<br />
  "Now Katie, are you mine, for Max is dead&mdash;<br />
  "Or will be soon, imprison'd by those boughs,<br />
  "Wounded and torn, sooth'd by the deadly palms<br />
  "Of the white, trait'rous frost; and buried then<br />
  "Under the snows that fill those vast, grey clouds,<br />
  "Low-sweeping on the fretted forest roof.<br />
  "And Katie shall believe you false&mdash;not dead;<br />
  "False, false!&mdash;And I? O, she shall find me true&mdash;<br />
  "True as a fabl'd devil to the soul<br />
  "He longs for with the heat of all hell's fires.<br />
  "These myths serve well for simile, I see.<br />
  "And yet&mdash;Down, Pity! knock not at my breast,<br />
  "Nor grope about for that dull stone my heart;<br />
  "I'll stone thee with it, Pity! Get thee hence,<br />
  "Pity, I'll strangle thee with naked hands;<br />
  "For thou dost bear upon thy downy breast<br />
  "Remorse, shap'd like a serpent, and her fangs<br />
  "Might dart at me and pierce my marrow thro'.<br />
  "Hence, beggar, hence&mdash;and keep with fools, I say!<br />
  "He bleeds and groans! Well, Max, thy God or mine<br />
  "Blind Chance, here play'd the butcher&mdash;'twas not I.<br />
  "Down, hands! ye shall not lift his fall'n head;<br />
  "What cords tug at ye? What? Ye'd pluck him up<br />
  "And staunch his wounds? There rises in my breast<br />
  "A strange, strong giant, throwing wide his arms<br />
  "And bursting all the granite of my heart!<br />
  "How like to quiv'ring flesh a stone may feel!<br />
  "Why, it has pangs! I'll none of them. I know<br />
  "Life is too short for anguish and for hearts&mdash;<br />
  "So I wrestle with thee, giant! and my will<br />
  "Turns the thumb, and thou shalt take the knife.<br />
  "Well done! I'll turn thee on the arena dust,<br />
  "And look on thee&mdash;What? thou wert Pity's self,<br />
  "Stol'n in my breast; and I have slaughter'd thee&mdash;<br />
  "But hist&mdash;where hast thou hidden thy fell snake,<br />
  "Fire-fang'd Remorse? Not in my breast, I know,<br />
  "For all again is chill and empty there,<br />
  "And hard and cold&mdash;the granite knitted up.<br />
  "So lie there, Max&mdash;poor fond and simple Max,<br />
  "'Tis well thou diest: earth's children should not call<br />
  "Such as thee father&mdash;let them ever be<br />
  "Father'd by rogues and villains, fit to cope<br />
  "With the foul dragon Chance, and the black knaves<br />
  "Who swarm'd in loathsome masses in the dust.<br />
  "True Max, lie there, and slumber into death."<br />

  Said the high hill, in the morning: "Look on me&mdash;<br />
  "Behold, sweet earth, sweet sister sky, behold<br />
  "The red flames on my peaks, and how my pines<br />
  "Are cressets of pure gold; my quarried scars<br />
  "Of black crevase and shadow-fill'd canon,<br />
  "Are trac'd in silver mist. How on my breast<br />
  "Hang the soft purple fringes of the night;<br />
  "Close to my shoulder droops the weary moon,<br />
  "Dove-pale, into the crimson surf the sun<br />
  "Drives up before his prow; and blackly stands<br />
  "On my slim, loftiest peak, an eagle, with<br />
  "His angry eyes set sunward, while his cry<br />
  "Falls fiercely back from all my ruddy heights;<br />
  "And his bald eaglets, in their bare, broad nest,<br />
  "Shrill pipe their angry echoes: "'Sun, arise,<br />
  "'And show me that pale dove, beside her nest,<br />
  "'Which I shall strike with piercing beak and tear<br />
  "'With iron talons for my hungry young.'"<br />
  And that mild dove, secure for yet a space,<br />
  Half waken'd, turns her ring'd and glossy neck<br />
  To watch dawn's ruby pulsing on her breast,<br />
  And see the first bright golden motes slip down<br />
  The gnarl'd trunks about her leaf-deep nest,<br />
  Nor sees nor fears the eagle on the peak.<br />

  "Yes, sing, sweet Kate," said Alfred in her ear;<br />
  "I often heard you singing in my dreams<br />

<p class="poem">
  And with the faint last cadence, stole a glance<br />
  At Malcolm's soften'd face&mdash;a bird-soft touch<br />
  Let flutter on the rugged silver snarls<br />
  Of his thick locks, and laid her tender lips<br />
  A second on the iron of his hand.<br />
  "And did you ever meet," he sudden ask'd,<br />
  Of Alfred, sitting pallid in the shade,<br />
  "Out by yon unco place, a lad,&mdash;a lad<br />
  "Nam'd Maxwell Gordon; tall, and straight, and strong;<br />
  "About my size, I take it, when a lad?"<br />
  And Katie at the sound of Max's name,<br />
  First spoken for such space by Malcolm's lips,<br />
  Trembl'd and started, and let down her brow,<br />
  Hiding its sudden rose on Malcolm's arm.<br />
  "Max Gordon? Yes. Was he a friend of yours?"<br />
  "No friend of mine, but of the lassie's here&mdash;<br />
  "How comes he on? I wager he's a drone,<br />
  "And never will put honey in the hive."<br />
  "No drone," said Alfred, laughing; "when I left<br />
  "He and his axe were quarr'ling with the woods<br />
  "And making forests reel&mdash;love steels a lover's arm."<br />
  O, blush that stole from Katie's swelling heart,<br />
  And with its hot rose brought the happy dew<br />
  Into her hidden eyes. "Aye, aye! is that the way?"<br />
  Said Malcolm smiling. "Who may be his love?"<br />
  "In that he is a somewhat simple soul,<br />
  "Why, I suppose he loves&mdash;" he paused, and Kate<br />
  Look'd up with two "forget-me-nots" for eyes,<br />
  With eager jewels in their centres set<br />
  Of happy, happy tears, and Alfred's heart<br />
  Became a closer marble than before.<br />
  "&mdash;Why I suppose he loves&mdash;his lawful wife."<br />
  "His wife! his wife!" said Malcolm, in a maze,<br />
  And laid his heavy hand on Katie's head;<br />
  "Did you play me false, my little lass?<br />
  "Speak and I'll pardon! Katie, lassie, what?"<br />
  "He has a wife," said Alfred, "lithe and bronz'd,<br />
  "An Indian woman, comelier than her kind;<br />
  "And on her knee a child with yellow locks,<br />
  "And lake-like eyes of mystic Indian brown.<br />
  "And so you knew him? He is doing well."<br />
  "False, false!" said Katie, lifting up her head.<br />
  "O, you know not the Max my father means!"<br />
  "He came from yonder farm-house on the slope."<br />
  "Some other Max&mdash;we speak not of the same."<br />
  "He has a red mark on his temple set."<br />
  "It matters not&mdash;'tis not the Max we know."<br />
  "He wears a turquoise ring slung round his neck."<br />
  "And many wear them&mdash;they are common stones."<br />
  "His mother's ring&mdash;her name was Helen Wynde."<br />
  "And there be many Helens who have sons."<br />
  "O Katie, credit me&mdash;it is the man."<br />
  "O not the man! Why, you have never told<br />
  "Us of the true soul that the true Max has;<br />
  "The Max we know has such a soul, I know."<br />
  "How know you that, my foolish little lass?"<br />
  Said Malcolm, a storm of anger bound<br />
  Within his heart, like Samson with green withs&mdash;<br />
  "Belike it is the false young cur we know!"<br />
  "No, no," said Katie, simply, and low-voic'd;<br />
  "If he were traitor I must needs be false,<br />
  "For long ago love melted our two hearts.<br />
  "And time has moulded those two hearts in one,<br />
  "And he is true since I am faithful still."<br />
  She rose and parted, trembling as she went,<br />
  Feeling the following steel of Alfred's eyes,<br />
  And with the icy hand of scorn'd mistrust<br />
  Searching about the pulses of her heart&mdash;<br />
  Feeling for Max's image in her breast.<br />
  "To-night she conquers Doubt; to-morrow's noon<br />
  "His following soldiers sap the golden wall,<br />
  "And I shall enter and possess the fort,"<br />
  Said Alfred, in his mind. "O Katie, child,<br />
  "Wilt thou be Nemesis, with yellow hair,<br />
  "To rend my breast? for I do feel a pulse<br />
  "Stir when I look into thy pure-barb'd eyes&mdash;<br />
  "O, am I breeding that false thing, a heart?<br />
  "Making my breast all tender for the fangs<br />
  "Of sharp Remorse to plunge their hot fire in.<br />
  "I am a certain dullard! Let me feel<br />
  "But one faint goad, fine as a needle's point,<br />
  "And it shall be the spur in my soul's side<br />
  "To urge the madd'ning thing across the jags<br />
  "And cliffs of life, into the soft embrace<br />
  "Of that cold mistress, who is constant too,<br />
  "And never flings her lovers from her arms&mdash;<br />
  "Not Death, for she is still a fruitful wife,<br />
  "Her spouse the Dead, and their cold marriage yields<br />
  "A million children, born of mould'ring flesh&mdash;<br />

  The Land had put his ruddy gauntlet on,<br />
  Of Harvest gold, to dash in Famine's face.<br />
  And like a vintage wain, deep dy'd with juice,<br />
  The great moon falter'd up the ripe, blue sky,<br />
  Drawn by silver stars&mdash;like oxen white<br />
  And horn'd with rays of light&mdash;Down the rich land<br />
  Malcolm's small valleys, fill'd with grain, lip-high,<br />
  Lay round a lonely hill that fac'd the moon,<br />
  And caught the wine-kiss of its ruddy light.<br />
  A cusp'd, dark wood caught in its black embrace<br />
  The valleys and the hill, and from its wilds,<br />
  Spic'd with dark cedars, cried the Whip-poor-will.<br />
  A crane, belated, sail'd across the moon;<br />
  On the bright, small, close link'd lakes green islets lay,<br />
  Dusk knots of tangl'd vines, or maple boughs,<br />
  Or tuft'd cedars, boss'd upon the waves.<br />
  The gay, enamell'd children of the swamp<br />
  Roll'd a low bass to treble, tinkling notes<br />
  Of little streamlets leaping from the woods.<br />
  Close to old Malcolm's mills, two wooden jaws<br />
  Bit up the water on a sloping floor;<br />
  And here, in season, rush'd the great logs down,<br />
  To seek the river winding on its way.<br />
  In a green sheen, smooth as a Naiad's locks,<br />
  The water roll'd between the shudd'ring jaws&mdash;<br />
  Then on the river level roar'd and reel'd&mdash;<br />
  In ivory-arm'd conflict with itself.<br />
  "Look down," said Alfred, "Katie, look and see<br />
  "How that but pictures my mad heart to you.<br />
  "It tears itself in fighting that mad love<br />
  "You swear is hopeless&mdash;hopeless&mdash;is it so?"<br />
  "Ah, yes!" said Katie, "ask me not again."<br />
  "But Katie, Max is false; no word has come,<br />
  "Nor any sign from him for many months,<br />
  "And&mdash;he is happy with his Indian wife."<br />
  She lifted eyes fair as the fresh grey dawn<br />
  with all its dews and promises of sun.<br />
  "O, Alfred!&mdash;saver of my little life&mdash;<br />
  "Look in my eyes and read them honestly."<br />
  He laugh'd till all the isles and forests laugh'd.<br />
  "O simple child! what may the forest flames<br />
  "See in the woodland ponds but their own fires?<br />
  "And have you, Katie, neither fears nor doubts?"<br />
  She, with the flow'r soft pinkness of her palm<br />
  Cover'd her sudden tears, then quickly said:<br />
  "Fears&mdash;never doubts, for true love never doubts."<br />
  Then Alfred paus'd a space, as one who holds<br />
  A white doe by the throat and searches for<br />
  The blade to slay her. "This your answer still&mdash;<br />
  "You doubt not&mdash;doubt not this far love of yours,<br />
  "Tho' sworn a false young recreant, Kate, by me?"<br />
  "He is as true as I am," Katie said;<br />
  "And did I seek for stronger simile,<br />
  "I could not find such in the universe!"<br />
  "And were he dead? what, Katie, were he dead&mdash;<br />
  "A handful of brown dust, a flame blown out&mdash;<br />
  "What then would love be strongly, true to&mdash;Naught?"<br />
  "Still, true to love my love would be," she said,<br />
  And faintly smiling, pointed to the stars.<br />
  "O fool!" said Alfred, stirr'd&mdash;as craters rock<br />
  "To their own throes&mdash;and over his pale lips<br />
  Roll'd flaming stone, his molten heart. "Then, fool&mdash;<br />
  "Be true to what thou wilt&mdash;for he is dead.<br />
  "And there have grown this gilded summer past<br />
  "Grasses and buds from his unburied flesh.<br />
  "I saw him dead. I heard his last, loud cry:<br />
  "'O Kate!' ring thro' the woods; in truth I did."<br />
  She half-raised up a piteous, pleading hand,<br />
  Then fell along the mosses at his feet.<br />
  "Now will I show I love you, Kate," he said,<br />
  "And give you gift of love; you shall not wake<br />
  "To feel the arrow, feather-deep, within<br />
  "Your constant heart. For me, I never meant<br />
  "To crawl an hour beyond what time I felt<br />
  "The strange, fang'd monster that they call Remorse<br />
  "Fold found my waken'd heart. The hour has come;<br />
  "And as Love grew, the welded folds of steel<br />
  "Slipp'd round in horrid zones. In Love's flaming eyes<br />
  "Stared its fell eyeballs, and with Hydra head<br />
  "It sank hot fangs in breast, and brow and thigh.<br />
  "Come, Kate! O Anguish is a simple knave<br />
  "Whom hucksters could outwit with small trade lies,<br />
  "When thus so easily his smarting thralls,<br />
  "May flee his knout! Come, come, my little Kate;<br />
  "The black porch with its fringe of poppies waits&mdash;<br />
  "A propylaleum hospitably wide.<br />
  "No lictors with their fasces at its jaws,<br />
  "Its floor as kindly to my fire-vein'd feet<br />
  "As to thy silver, lilied, sinless ones.<br />
  "O you shall slumber soundly, tho' the white,<br />
  "Wild waters pluck the crocus of your hair;<br />
  "And scaly spies stare with round, lightless eyes<br />
  "At your small face laid on my stony breast.<br />
  "Come, Kate! I must not have you wake, dear heart,<br />
  "To hear you cry, perchance, on your dead Max."<br />
  He turn'd her still, face close upon his breast,<br />
  And with his lips upon her soft, ring'd hair,<br />
  Leap'd from the bank, low shelving o'er the knot<br />
  Of frantic waters at the long slide's foot.<br />
  And as the sever'd waters crash'd and smote<br />
  Together once again,&mdash;within the wave<br />
  Stunn'd chamber of his ear there peal'd a cry:<br />
  "O Kate! stay, madman; traitor, stay! O Kate!"<br />

  Max, gaunt as prairie wolves in famine time,<br />
  With long drawn sickness, reel'd upon the bank&mdash;<br />
  Katie, new-rescu'd, waking in his arms.<br />
  On the white riot of the waters gleam'd,<br />
  The face of Alfred, calm, with close-seal'd eyes,<br />
  And blood red on his temple where it smote<br />
  The mossy timbers of the groaning slide.<br />
  "O God!" said Max, as Katie's opening eyes<br />
  Looked up to his, slow budding to a smile<br />
  Of wonder and of bliss, "My Kate, my Kate!"<br />
  She saw within his eyes a larger soul<br />
  Than that light spirit that before she knew,<br />
  And read the meaning of his glance and words.<br />
  "Do as you will, my Max. I would not keep<br />
  "You back with one light-falling finger-tip!"<br />
  And cast herself from his large arms upon<br />
  The mosses at his feet, and hid her face<br />
  That she might not behold what he would do;<br />
  Or lest the terror in her shining eyes<br />
  Might bind him to her, and prevent his soul<br />
  Work out its greatness; and her long, wet hair<br />
  Drew, mass'd, about her ears, to shut the sound<br />
  Of the vex'd waters from her anguish'd brain.<br />
  Max look'd upon her, turning as he look'd.<br />
  A moment came a voice in Katie's soul:<br />
  "Arise, be not dismay'd; arise and look;<br />
  "If he should perish, 'twill be as a God,<br />
  "For he would die to save his enemy."<br />
  But answer'd her torn heart: "I cannot look&mdash;<br />
  "I cannot look and see him sob and die;<br />
  "In those pale, angry arms. O, let me rest<br />
  "Blind, blind and deaf until the swift pac'd end.<br />
  "My Max! O God&mdash;was that his Katie's name?"<br />
  Like a pale dove, hawk-hunted, Katie ran,<br />
  Her fear's beak in her shoulder; and below,<br />
  Where the coil'd waters straighten'd to a stream,<br />
  Found Max all bruis'd and bleeding on they bank,<br />
  But smiling with man's triumph in his eyes,<br />
  When he has on fierce Danger's lion neck<br />
  Plac'd his right hand and pluck'd the prey away.<br />
  And at his feet lay Alfred, still and while,<br />
  A willow's shadow tremb'ling on his face,<br />
  "There lies the false, fair devil, O my Kate,<br />
  "Who would have parted us, but could not, Kate!"<br />
  "But could not, Max," said Katie. "Is he dead?"<br />
  But, swift perusing Max's strange, dear face,<br />
  Close clasp'd against his breast&mdash;forgot him straight<br />
  And ev'ry other evil thing upon<br />
  The broad green earth.<br />

  On the rude walls, and in the trellis'd porch<br />
  Sat Katie, smiling o'er the rich, fresh fields;<br />

  "Beck'ning pale starvelings with their fresh, green hands,<br />
  "And with their ashes mellowing the earth,<br />
  "That she may yield her increase willingly.<br />
  "I would not change these wild and rocking woods,<br />
  "Dotted by little homes of unbark'd trees,<br />

  THE ROMAN ROSE-SELLER<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Not from Paestum come my roses; Patrons, see<br />
  My flowers are Roman-blown; their nectaries<br />
  Drop honey amber, and their petals throw<br />
  Rich crimsons on the lucent marble of the shrine<br />
  Where snowy Dian lifts her pallid brow,<br />
  As crimson lips of Love may seek to warm<br />
  A sister glow in hearts as pulseless hewn.<br />
  Caesar from Afric wars returns to-day;<br />
  Patricians, buy my royal roses; strew<br />
  His way knee-deep, as though old Tiber roll'd<br />
  A tide of musky roses from his bed to do<br />
  A wonder, wond'rous homage. Marcus Lucius, thou<br />
  To-day dost wed; buy roses, roses, roses,<br />
  To mingle with the nuptial myrtle; look,<br />
  I strip the polish'd thorns from the stems,<br />
  The nuptial rose should be a stingless flower;<br />
  Lucania, pass not by my roses. Virginia,<br />
  Here is a rose that has a canker in't, and yet<br />
  It is most glorious-dyed and sweeter smells<br />
  Than those death hath not touched. To-day they bear<br />
  The shield of Claudius with his spear upon it,<br />
  Close upon Caesar's chariot&mdash;heap, heap it up<br />
  With roses such as these; 'tis true he's dead<br />
  And there's the canker! but, Romans, he<br />
  Died glorious, there's the perfume! and his virtues<br />
  Are these bright petals; so buy my roses, Widow.<br />
  No Greek-born roses mine. Priestess, priestess!<br />
  Thy ivory chariot stay; here's a rose and not<br />
  A white one, though thy chaste hands attend<br />
  On Vesta's flame. Love's of a colour&mdash;be it that<br />
  Which ladders Heaven and lives amongst the Gods;<br />
  Or like the Daffodil blows all about the earth;<br />
  Or, Hesperus like, is one sole star upon<br />
  The solemn sky which bridges same sad life,<br />
  So here's a crimson rose: Be, thou as pure<br />
  As Dian's tears iced on her silver cheek,<br />
  And know no quality of love, thou art<br />
  A sorrow to the Gods! Oh mighty Love!<br />
  I would my roses could but chorus Thee.<br />
  No roses of Persepolis are mine. Helot, here&mdash;<br />
  I give thee this last blossom: A bee as red<br />
  As Hybla's golden toilers sucked its sweets;<br />
  A butterfly, wing'd like to Eros nipp'd<br />
  Its new-pinked leaves; the sun, bright despot, stole<br />
  The dew night gives to all. Poor slave, methinks<br />
  A bough of cypress were as gay a gift, and yet<br />
  It hath some beauty left! a little scarlet&mdash;for<br />
  The Gods love all; a little perfume, for there is no life,<br />
  Poor slave, but hath its sweetness. Thus I make<br />
  My roses Oracles. O hark! the cymbals beat<br />
  In god-like silver bursts of sound; I go<br />
  To see great Caesar leading Glory home,<br />
  From Campus Martius to the Capitol!<br />

  THE WOOING OF GHEEZIS.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  The red chief Gheezis, chief of the golden wampum, lay<br />
  And watched the west-wind blow adrift the clouds,<br />
  With breath all flowery, that from his calumet<br />
  Curl'd like to smoke about the mountain tops.<br />
  Gheezis look'd from his wigwam, blue as little pools<br />
  Drained from the restless mother-wave, that lay<br />
  Dreaming in golden hollows of her sands;<br />
  And deck'd his yellow locks with feath'ry clouds,<br />
  And took his pointed arrows and so stoop'd<br />
  And leaning with his red hands on the hills,<br />
  Look'd with long glances all along the earth.<br />
  "Mudjekeewis, West-Wind, in amongst the forest,<br />
  "I see a maid, gold-hued as maize full ripe; her eyes<br />
  "Laugh under the dusk boughs like watercourses;<br />
  "Her moccasins are wrought with threads of light: her hands<br />
  "Are full of blue eggs of the robin, and of buds<br />
  "Of lilies, and green spears of rice: O Mudjekeewis,<br />
  "Who is the maid, gold-hued as maize full-ripen'd?"<br />
  "O sun, O Gheezis, that is Spring, is Segwun&mdash;woo her!"<br />
  "I cannot, for she hides behind the behmagut&mdash;<br />
  "The thick leav'd grape-vine, and there laughs upon me."<br />
  "O Gheezis," cried Segwun from behind the grape-vine.<br />
  "Thy arms are long but all too short to reach me,<br />
  "Thou art in heaven and I upon the earth!"<br />
  Gheezis, with long, golden fingers tore the grape-vine,<br />
  But Segwun laughed upon him from behind<br />
  A maple, shaking little leaves of gold fresh-budded.<br />
  "Gheezis, where are thy feet, O sun, O chief?"<br />
  "Follow," sigh'd Mudjekeewis, "Gheezis must wed<br />
  "With Spring, with Segwun, or all nature die."<br />
  The red chief Gheezis swift ran down the hills,<br />
  And as he ran the pools and watercourses<br />
  Snatch'd at his yellow hair; the thickets caught<br />
  Its tendrils on their brambles; and the buds<br />
  That Segwun dropp'd, opened as they touched.<br />
  His moccasins were flame, his wampum gold;<br />
  His plumes were clouds white as the snow, and red<br />
  As Sumach in the moon of falling leaves.<br />
  He slipp'd beside the maple, Segwun laugh'd.<br />
  "O Gheezis, I am hid amid the lily-pads,<br />
  "And thou hast no canoe to seek me there; farewell!"<br />
  "I see thine eyes, O Segwun, laugh behind the buds;<br />
  "The Manitou is love, and gives me love, and love<br />
  "Gives all of power." His moccasins wide laid<br />
  Red tracks upon the waves: When Segwun leap'd<br />
  Gold-red and laughing from the lily-pads,<br />
  To flit before him like a fire-fly, she found<br />
  The golden arms of Gheezis round her cast, the buds<br />
  Burst into flower in her hands, and all the earth<br />
  Laughing where Gheezis look'd; and Mudjekeewis,<br />
  Heart friend of Gheezis, laugh'd, "Now life is come<br />
  "Since Segwun and red Gheezis wed and reign!"<br />

  "First tell me of its name?" she bent<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her eyes divine and innocent<br />
  On his. He raised his hand above<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its prow, and answ'ring swore, "'Tis Love!"<br />
  "Now tell," she ask'd, "how is it built,<br />
  Of gold or worthless timber gilt?"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Of gold," he said. "Whence named?" asked she,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roses of her lips apart,<br />
  She paus'd&mdash;a lily by the sea&mdash;<br />

  She laid her light palm in his hand.<br />

  THE HIDDEN ROOM.<br />

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I marvel if my heart,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath any room apart,<br />
  Built secretly its mystic walls within;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With subtly warded key.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ne'er yielded unto me&mdash;<br />
  Where even I have surely never been.<br />

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, surely I know all<br />

  With the fire ever red upon its hearth;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friends dwell with me there,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor comes the step of Care<br />
  To sadden down its music and its mirth.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full well I know as mine,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little cloister'd shrine<br />
  No foot but mine alone hath ever trod;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There come the shining wings&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of one who brings<br />
  The pray'rs of men before the throne of God.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many know full well,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The busy, busy cell,<br />
  Where I toil at the work I have to do,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor is the portal fast,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where stand phantoms of the past,<br />
  Or grow the bitter plants of darksome rue.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the dainty spot<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ah, who doth know it not?)<br />
  Where pure young Love his lily-cradle made;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And nestled some sweet springs<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With lily-spangled wings&mdash;<br />
  Forget-me-nots upon his bier I laid.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet marvel I, my soul,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know I thy very whole,<br />
  Or dost thou hide a chamber still from me?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it built upon the wall?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it spacious? is it small?<br />
  Is it God, or man, or I who holds the key?<br />

  THE BURGOMEISTER'S WELL.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  A peaceful spot, a little street,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So still between the double roar<br />
  Of sea and city that it seemed<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rest in music, set before<br />
  Some clashing chords&mdash;vibrating yet<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hurried measures fast and sweet;<br />
  For so the harsh chords of the town,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so the ocean's rythmic beat.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A little street with linden trees<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So thickly set, the belfry's face<br />
  Was leaf-veiled, while above them pierced,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four slender spires flamboyant grace.<br />
  Old porches carven when the trees,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were seedlings yellow in the sun<br />
  Five hundred years ago that bright<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the quaint old city shone.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A fountain prim, and richly cut<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In ruddy granite, carved to tell<br />
  How a good burgomeister rear'd<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone above the people's well.<br />
  A sea-horse from his nostrils blew<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two silver threads; a dragon's lip<br />
  Dropp'd di'monds, and a giant hand<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Held high an urn on finger tip.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Twas there I met my little maid,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There saw her flaxen tresses first;<br />
  She filled the cup for one who lean'd<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A soldier, crippl'd and athirst)<br />
  Against the basin's carven rim;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her dear small hand's white loveliness<br />
  Was pinkly flush'd, the gay bright drops<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plash'd on her brow and silken dress.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I took the flagon from her hand,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too small, dear hand, for such a weight.<br />
  From cobweb weft and woof is spun<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tapestry of Life and Fate!<br />
  The linden trees had gilded buds,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dove wheeled high on joyous wing,<br />
  When on that darling hand of hers<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I slipped the glimmer of a ring.<br />
  Ah, golden heart, and golden locks<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye wove so sweet, so sure a spell!<br />
  That quiet day I saw her first<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the Burgomeister's Well!<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the ocean-hidden rock,<br />
  When tempests strike thee full and leave thee blind;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And low the inky clouds,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blackly tangle in thy shrouds;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And ev'ry strained cord<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the dead whom it has slain<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lie in the strict embrace<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of secret weird tendrils; but the pain<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the ocean's strong remorse<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doth fiercely force<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tale of murder from its bosom out<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a mighty tempest clangour, and its shout<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the threat'ning and lamenting of its swell<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is as the voice of Hell,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet all the word it saith<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is 'Death.'"<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whirl and flame of scarlet leaves<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With strong desire<br />

  His heart grown faint, his feet grown weak,<br />

<p class="poem">
  By whirling winds from ashy ring,<br />

<h3>
  THE SHELL.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  O little, whisp'ring, murm'ring shell, say cans't thou tell to me<br />
  Good news of any stately ship that sails upon the sea?<br />
  I press my ear, O little shell, against thy rosy lips;<br />
  Cans't tell me tales of those who go down to the sea in ships?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  What, not a word?  Ah hearken, shell, I've shut the cottage door;<br />
  There's scarce a sound to drown thy voice, so silent is the moor,<br />
  A bell may tinkle far away upon its purple rise;<br />
  A bee may buz among the heath&mdash;a lavrock cleave the skies.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But if you only breathe the name I name upon my knees,<br />
  Ah, surely I should catch the word above such sounds as these.<br />
  And Grannie's needles click no more, the ball of yarn is done,<br />
  And she's asleep outside the door where shines the merry sun.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  One night while Grannie slept, I dreamed he came across the moor,<br />
  And stood, so handsome, brown and tall, beside the open door:<br />
  I thought I turned to pick a rose that by the sill had blown,<br />
  (He liked a rose) and when I looked, O shell, I was alone!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Across the moor there dwells a wife; she spaed my fortune true,<br />
  And said I'd plight my troth with one who ware a jacket blue;<br />
  That morn before my Grannie woke, just when the lapwing stirred,<br />
  I sped across the misty rise and sought the old wife's word.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  With her it was the milking time, and while she milk'd the goat,<br />
  I ask'd her then to spae my dream, my heart was in my throat&mdash;<br />
  But that was just because the way had been so steep and long,<br />
  And not because I had the fear that anything was wrong.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Ye'll meet, ye'll meet," was all she said; "Ye'll meet when it is mirk."<br />
  I gave her tippence that I meant for Sabbath-day and kirk;<br />
  And then I hastened back again; it seemed that never sure<br />
  The happy sun delay'd so long to gild the purple moor.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  That's six months back, and every night I sit beside the door,<br />
  And while I knit I keep my gaze upon the mirky moor;<br />
  I keep old Collie by my side&mdash;he's sure to spring and bark,<br />
  When Ronald comes across the moor to meet me in the dark.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I <i>know</i> the old wife spaed me true, for did she not fore-tell<br />
  I'd break a ring with Ronald Grey beside the Hidden Well?<br />
  It came to pass at shearing-time, before he went to sea<br />
  (We're nighbours' bairns) how <i>could</i> she know that Ronald cared<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for me.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  So night by night I watch for him&mdash;by day I sing and work,<br />
  And try to never mind the latch&mdash;he's coming in the dark;<br />
  Yet as the days and weeks and months go slipping slowly thro',<br />
  I wonder if the wise old wife has spaed my fortune true!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Ah, not a word about his ship? Well, well, I'll lay thee by.<br />
  I see a heron from the marsh go sailing in the sky,<br />
  The purple moor is like a dream, a star is twinkling clear&mdash;<br />
  Perhaps the meeting that she spaed is drawing very near!<br />
</p>

<h3>
  TWO SONGS OF SPAIN.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Fountain, cans't thou sing the song<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Juan sang to me<br />
  The moonlit orange groves among?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then list the words from me,<br />
  And mark thee, by the morning's light,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or by the moon's soft beam,<br />
  Or when my eyes with smiles are bright,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or when I wake or dream.<br />
  O, Fountain, thou must sing the song<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Juan sang to me;<br />
  Yet stay&mdash;the only words I know<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are "Inez, Love and Thee!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Fountain, on my light guitar<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll play the strain to thee,<br />
  And while I watch yon laughing star,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words will come to me.<br />
  And mark thee, when my heart is sad,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And full of sweet regrets,<br />
  Or when it throbs to laughter glad,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like feet to castanets.<br />
  O, Fountain, thou must sing the song<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Juan sang to me;<br />
  Yet stay&mdash;the only words I know<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are "Inez, Love, and Thee!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Fountain, clap thy twinkling hands<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath yon floating moon,<br />
  And twinkle to the starry bands<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That dance upon the gloom,<br />
  For I am glad, for who could crave,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The joyous night to fill,<br />
  A richer treasure than I have<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Juan's seguedille?<br />
  So, Fountain, mark, no other song<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dare ever sing, to me,<br />
  Tho' only four short words I know,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just, "Inez, Love and Thee!"<br />

<p class="poem">
  Morello strikes on his guitar,<br />
  When over the olives the star<br />
  Of eve, like a rose touch'd with gold,<br />
  Doth slowly its sweet rays unfold.<br />
  Perchance 'tis in some city square,<br />
  And the people all follow us there.<br />
  Don, donna, slim chulo, padrone,<br />
  The very dog runs with his bone;<br />
  One half of the square is in the shade,<br />
  On the other the red sunset fades;<br />
  The fount, as it flings up its jets,<br />
  Responds to my brisk castanets;<br />
  I wear a red rose at my ear;<br />
  And many a whisper I hear:<br />
  "If she were a lady, behold,<br />
  None other should share my red gold!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "St. Anthony save us, what eyes!<br />
  How gem-like her little foot flies!"<br />
  "These dancers should all be forbid<br />
  To dance in the streets of Madrid."<br />
  "If I were a monarch I'd own<br />
  No other to sit on my throne!"<br />
  Two scarlet streamers tie my hair;<br />
  They burn like red stars on the air;<br />
  My dark eyes flash, my clear cheek burns,<br />
  My kirtle eddies in swift turns,<br />
  My golden necklet tinkles sweet;<br />
  Yes, yes, I love the crowded street!<br />

<h3>
  THE CITY TREE.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  I stand within the stony, arid town,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gaze for ever on the narrow street;<br />
  I hear for ever passing up and down,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceaseless tramp of feet.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I know no brotherhood with far-lock'd woods,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where branches bourgeon from a kindred sap;<br />
  Where o'er moss'd roots, in cool, green solitudes,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small silver brooklets lap.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  No em'rald vines creep wistfully to me,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lay their tender fingers on my bark;<br />
  High may I toss my boughs, yet never see<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn's first most glorious spark.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  When to and fro my branches wave and sway,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answ'ring the feeble wind that faintly calls,<br />
  They kiss no kindred boughs but touch alway<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stones of climbing walls.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  My heart is never pierc'd with song of bird;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My leaves know nothing of that glad unrest,<br />

<p class="poem">
  There never glance the eyes of violets up,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue into the deep splendour of my green:<br />

<p class="poem">
  Not mine, not mine to turn from soft delight<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of wood-bine breathings, honey sweet, and warm;<br />
  With kin embattl'd rear my glorious height<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To greet the coming storm!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Not mine to watch across the free, broad plains<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whirl of stormy cohorts sweeping fast;<br />
  The level, silver lances of great rains,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blown onward by the blast.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Not mine the clamouring tempest to defy,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tossing the proud crest of my dusky leaves:<br />
  Defender of small flowers that trembling lie<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against my barky greaves.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Not mine to watch the wild swan drift above,<br />
   Balanced on wings that could not choose between<br />
  The wooing sky, blue as the eye of love,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my own tender green.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And yet my branches spread, a kingly sight,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the close prison of the drooping air:<br />
  When sun-vex'd noons are at their fiery height,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My shade is broad, and there<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Come city toilers, who their hour of ease<br />

</p>

<p class="poem">
  I see no flowers, but as the children race<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With noise and clamour through the dusty street,<br />
  I see the bud of many an angel face&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear their merry feet.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  No violets look up, but shy and grave,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children pause and lift their chrystal eyes<br />

  He stood beside her in the dawn<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(And she his Dawn and she his Spring),<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her swift eyes chased the swallow's wing:<br />
  Her restless lips, smile-haunted, cast<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shrill silver calls to hound and dove:<br />
  Her young locks wove them with the blast.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the flush'd, azure shrine above,<br />
  The light boughs o'er her golden head<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toss'd em'rald arm and blossom palm.<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sweet wind in breath of balm.<br />

  "Dawn of my heart," he said, "O child,<br />

  "The Dawn is young," she smiled and said,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too young for Love's dear joy and woe;<br />
  Too young to crown her careless head<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his ripe roses. Let me go&mdash;<br />
  Unquestion'd for a longer space,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perchance, when day is at the flood,<br />
  In thy true palm I'll gladly place<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love's flower in its rounding bud.<br />
  But now the day is all too young,<br />
   The Dawn and I are playmates still."<br />
  She slipped the blossomed boughs among,<br />

  Again they stand (Imperial noon<br />

  Its silent song of sun and fire.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wheeling swallows smite the skies<br />
  And upward draw the faint desire,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weaving its myst'ry in her eyes.<br />
  In the white kisses of the tips<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of her long fingers lies a rose,<br />
  Snow-pale beside her curving lips,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red by her snowy breast it glows.<br />

  "Noon of my soul," he says, "behold!<br />

<h3>
  CURTIUS.<br />
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  How spake the Oracle, my Curtius, how?<br />
  Methought, while on the shadow'd terraces<br />
  I walked and looked towards Rome, an echo came,<br />
  Of legion wails, blent into one deep cry.<br />
  "O, Jove!" I thought, "the Oracles have said;<br />
  And saying, touched some swiftly answering chord,<br />
  Gen'ral to ev'ry soul."  And then my heart<br />
  (I being here alone) beat strangely loud;<br />
  Responsive to the cry&mdash;and my still soul,<br />
  Inform'd me thus: "Not such a harmony<br />
  Could spring from aught within the souls of men,<br />
  But that which is most common to all souls.<br />
  Lo! that is sorrow!" "Nay, Curtius, I could smile,<br />
  To tell thee as I listen'd to the cry,<br />
  How on the silver flax which blew about<br />
  The ivory distaff in my languid hand,<br />
  I found large tears; such big and rounded drops<br />
  As gather thro' dark nights on cypress boughs,<br />
  And I was sudden anger'd, for I thought:<br />
  "Why should a gen'ral wail come home to me<br />
  With such vibration in my trembling heart,<br />
  That such great tears should rise and overflow?"<br />
  Then shook them on the marble where I pac'd;<br />
  Where instantly they vanished in the sun,<br />
  As di'monds fade in flames, 'twas foolish, Curtius!<br />
  And then methought how strange and lone it seem'd,<br />
  For till thou cam'st I seem'd to be alone,<br />
  On the vin'd terrace, prison'd in the gold<br />
  Of that still noontide hour. No widows stole<br />
  Up the snow-glimmering marble of the steps<br />
  To take my alms and bless the Gods and me;<br />
  No orphans touched the fringes of my robe<br />
  With innocent babe-fingers, nor dropped the gold<br />
  I laid in their soft palms, to laugh, and stroke<br />
  The jewels on my neck, or touch the rose<br />
  Thou sayest, Curtius, lives upon my cheek.<br />
  Perchance all lingered in the Roman streets<br />
  To catch first tidings from the Oracles.<br />
  The very peacocks drows'd in distant shades,<br />
  Nor sought my hand for honey'd cake; and high<br />
  A hawk sailed blackly in the clear blue sky,<br />
  And kept my doves from cooing at my feet.<br />
  My lute lay there, bound with the small white buds,<br />
  Which, laughing this bright morn, thou brought and wreath'd<br />
  Around it as I sang&mdash;but with that wail<br />
  Dying across the vines and purple slopes,<br />
  And breaking on its strings, I did not care<br />
  To waken music, nor in truth could force<br />
  My voice or fingers to it, so I stray'd<br />
  Where hangs thy best loved armour on the wall,<br />
  And pleased myself by filling it with thee!<br />
  'Tis yet the goodliest armour in proud Rome,<br />
  Say all the armourers; all Rome and I<br />
  Know <i>thee</i>, the lordliest bearer of a sword.<br />
  Yet, Curtius, stay, there is a rivet lost<br />
  From out the helmet, and a ruby gone<br />
  From the short sword hilt&mdash;trifles both which can<br />
  Be righted by to-morrow's noon&mdash;"to-morrow's noon!"<br />
  Was there a change, my Curtius, in my voice<br />
  When spake I those three words: "to-morrow's noon?"<br />
  O, I am full of dreams&mdash;methought there was.<br />
  "Why, love, how darkly gaze thine eyes in mine!<br />
  If lov'd I dismal thoughts I well could deem<br />
  Thou saw'st not the blue of my fond eyes,<br />
  But looked between the lips of that dread pit&mdash;<br />
  O, Jove! to name it seems to curse the air<br />
  With chills of death&mdash;we'll not speak of it, Curtius.<br />
  When I had dimm'd thy shield with kissing it,<br />
  I went between the olives to the stalls;<br />
  White Audax neigh'd out to me as I came,<br />
  As I had been Hippona to his eyes;<br />
  New dazzling from the one, small, mystic cloud<br />
  That like a silver chariot floated low<br />
  In the ripe blue of noon, and seem'd to pause,<br />
  Stay'd by the hilly round of yon aged tree.<br />
  He stretch'd the ivory arch of his vast neck,<br />
  Smiting sharp thunders from the marble floor<br />
  With hoofs impatient of a peaceful earth;<br />
  Shook the long silver of his burnish'd mane,<br />
  Until the sunbeams smote it into light,<br />
  Such as a comet trails across the sky.<br />
  I love him, Curtius! Such magnanimous fires<br />
  Leap from his eyes. I do truly think<br />
  That with thee seated on him, thy strong knees<br />
  Against his sides&mdash;the bridle in his jaws<br />
  In thy lov'd hand, to pleasure thee he'd spring<br />
  Sheer from the verge of Earth into the breast<br />
  Of Death and Chaos&mdash;of Death and Chaos!&mdash;<br />
  What omens seem to strike my soul to-day?<br />
  What is there in this blossom hour should knit<br />
  An omen in with ev'ry simple word?<br />
  Should make yon willows with their hanging locks<br />
  Dusk sybils, mutt'ring sorrows to the air?<br />
  The roses clamb'ring round yon marble Pan,<br />
  Wave like red banners floating o'er the dead?<br />
  The dead&mdash;there 'tis again. My Curtius, come<br />
  And thou shalt tell me of the Oracles<br />
  And what sent hither that long cry of woe.<br />
  Yet wait, yet wait, I care not much to hear.<br />
  While on thy charger's throbbing neck I lean'd,<br />
  Romeward there pass'd across the violet slopes,<br />
  Five sacrificial bulls, with silver hides,<br />
  And horns as cusp'd and white as Dian's bow,<br />
  And lordly breasts which laid the honey'd thyme<br />
  Into long swarths, whence smoke of yellow bees<br />
  Rose up in puffs, dispersing as it rose,<br />
  For the great temple they; and as they pass'd<br />
  With quiet gait, I heard their drivers say:<br />
  The bulls were for the Altars, when should come<br />
  Word from the Oracles, as to the Pit,<br />
  O, Curtius, Curtius, in my soul I see<br />
  How black and fearful is its glutton throat;<br />
  I will not look!<br />
  O, Soul, be blind and see not! Then the men<br />
  Wav'd their long goads, still juicy from the vine,<br />
  And plum'd with bronzy leaves, and each to each,<br />
  Showed the sleek beauty of the rounded sides,<br />
  The mighty curving of the lordly breasts,<br />
  The level lines of backs, the small, fine heads,<br />
  And laugh'd and said, "The Gods will have it thus,<br />
  The choicest of the earth for sacrifice;<br />
  Let it be man, or maid, or lowing bull!"<br />
  Where lay the witchcraft in their clownish words,<br />
  To shake my heart? I know not; but it thrill'd,<br />
  As Daphne's leaves, thrill to a wind so soft,<br />
  One might not feel it on the open palm;<br />
  I cannot choose but laugh&mdash;for what have I<br />
  To do with altars and with sacrifice?<br />

  The boys to wonder at the Clown,<br />

  To ancient types, by Darwin's rule,<br />
  He simply said, "Wal, darn a fool."<br />

<p class="poem">

  BETWEEN THE WIND AND RAIN.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  "The storm is in the air," she said, and held<br />
  Her soft palm to the breeze; and looking up,<br />
  Swift sunbeams brush'd the crystal of her eyes,<br />
  As swallows leave the skies to skim the brown,<br />
  Bright woodland lakes. "The rain is in the air.<br />
  "O Prophet Wind, what hast thou told the rose,<br />
  "That suddenly she loosens her red heart,<br />
  "And sends long, perfum'd sighs about the place?<br />
  "O Prophet Wind, what hast thou told the Swift,<br />
  "That from the airy eave, she, shadow-grey,<br />
  "Smites the blue pond, and speeds her glancing wing<br />
  "Close to the daffodils? What hast thou told small bells,<br />
  "And tender buds, that&mdash;all unlike the rose&mdash;<br />
  "They draw green leaves close, close about their breasts<br />
  "And shrink to sudden slumber? The sycamores<br />
  "In ev'ry leaf are eloquent with thee;<br />
  "The poplars busy all their silver tongues<br />
  "With answ'ring thee, and the round chestnut stirs<br />
  "Vastly but softly, at thy prophecies.<br />
  "The vines grow dusky with a deeper green&mdash;<br />
  "And with their tendrils snatch thy passing harp,<br />
  "And keep it by brief seconds in their leaves.<br />
  "O Prophet Wind, thou tellest of the rain,<br />
  "While, jacinth blue, the broad sky folds calm palms,<br />
  "Unwitting of all storm, high o'er the land!<br />
  "The little grasses and the ruddy heath<br />
  "Know of the coming rain; but towards the sun<br />
  "The eagle lifts his eyes, and with his wings<br />
  "Beats on a sunlight that is never marr'd<br />
  "By cloud or mist, shrieks his fierce joy to air<br />
  "Ne'er stir'd by stormy pulse."<br />
  "The eagle mine," I said: "O I would ride<br />
  "His wings like Ganymede, nor ever care<br />
  "To drop upon the stormy earth again,&mdash;<br />
  "But circle star-ward, narrowing my gyres,<br />
  "To some great planet of eternal peace.".<br />
  "Nay," said my wise, young love, "the eagle falls<br />
  "Back to his cliff, swift as a thunder-bolt;<br />
  "For there his mate and naked eaglets dwell,<br />
  "And there he rends the dove, and joys in all<br />
  "The fierce delights of his tempestuous home.<br />
  "And tho' the stormy Earth throbs thro' her poles&mdash;<br />
  "With tempests rocks upon her circling path&mdash;<br />
  "And bleak, black clouds snatch at her purple hills&mdash;<br />
  "While mate and eaglets shriek upon the rock&mdash;<br />
  "The eagle leaves the hylas to its calm,<br />
  "Beats the wild storm apart that rings the earth,<br />
  "And seeks his eyrie on the wind-dash'd cliff.<br />
  "O Prophet Wind! close, close the storm and rain!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Long sway'd the grasses like a rolling wave<br />
  Above an undertow&mdash;the mastiff cried;<br />
  Low swept the poplars, groaning in their hearts;<br />
  And iron-footed stood the gnarl'd oaks,<br />
  And brac'd their woody thews against the storm.<br />
  Lash'd from the pond, the iv'ry cygnets sought<br />
  The carven steps that plung'd into the pool;<br />
  The peacocks scream'd and dragg'd forgotten plumes.<br />
  On the sheer turf&mdash;all shadows subtly died,<br />
  In one large shadow sweeping o'er the land;<br />
  Bright windows in the ivy blush'd no more;<br />
  The ripe, red walls grew pale&mdash;the tall vane dim;<br />
  Like a swift off'ring to an angry God,<br />
  O'erweighted vines shook plum and apricot,<br />
  From trembling trellis, and the rose trees pour'd<br />
  A red libation of sweet, ripen'd leaves,<br />
  On the trim walks. To the high dove-cote set<br />
  A stream of silver wings and violet breasts,<br />
  The hawk-like storm swooping on their track.<br />
  "Go," said my love, "the storm would whirl me off<br />
  "As thistle-down. I'll shelter here&mdash;but you&mdash;<br />
  "You love no storms!" "Where thou art," I said,<br />
  "Is all the calm I know&mdash;wert thou enthron'd<br />
  "On the pivot of the winds&mdash;or in the maelstrom,<br />
  "Thou holdest in thy hand my palm of peace;<br />
  "And, like the eagle, I would break the belts<br />
  "Of shouting tempests to return to thee,<br />
  "Were I above the storm on broad wings.<br />
  "Yet no she-eagle thou! a small, white, lily girl<br />
  "I clasp and lift and carry from the rain,<br />
  "Across the windy lawn."<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   With this I wove<br />
  Her floating lace about her floating hair,<br />
  And crush'd her snowy raiment to my breast,<br />
  And while she thought of frowns, but smil'd instead,<br />
  And wrote her heart in crimson on her cheeks,<br />
  I bounded with her up the breezy slopes,<br />
  The storm about us with such airy din,<br />
  As of a thousand bugles, that my heart<br />
  Took courage in the clamor, and I laid<br />
  My lips upon the flow'r of her pink ear,<br />
  And said: "I love thee; give me love again!"<br />
  And here she pal'd, love has its dread, and then<br />
  She clasp'd its joy and redden'd in its light,<br />
  Till all the daffodils I trod were pale<br />
  Beside the small flow'r red upon my breast.<br />
  And ere the dial on the slope was pass'd,<br />
  Between the last loud bugle of the Wind<br />
  And the first silver coinage of the Rain,<br />
  Upon my flying hair, there came her kiss,<br />
  Gentle and pure upon my face&mdash;and thus<br />
  Were we betroth'd between the Wind and Rain.<br />

  JOY'S CITY.<br />

  Joy's City hath high battlements of gold;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joy's City hath her streets of gem-wrought flow'rs;<br />
  She hath her palaces high reared and bold,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tender shades of perfumed lily bowers;<br />
  But ever day by day, and ever night by night,<br />
  An Angel measures still our City of Delight.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  He hath a rule of gold, and never stays,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But ceaseless round the burnish'd ramparts glides;<br />
  He measures minutes of her joyous days,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her walls, her trees, the music of her tides;<br />
  The roundness of her buds&mdash;Joy's own fair city lies,<br />
  Known to its heart-core by his stern and thoughtful eyes.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Above the sounds of timbrel and of song,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of greeting friends, of lovers 'mid the flowers,<br />
  The Angel's voice arises clear and strong:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O City, by so many leagues thy bow'rs<br />
  Stretch o'er the plains, and in the fair high-lifted blue<br />
  So many cubits rise thy tow'rs beyond the view."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Why dost thou, Angel, measure Joy's fair walls?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unceasing gliding by their burnish'd stones;<br />
  Go, rather measure Sorrow's gloomy halls;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her cypress bow'rs, her charnel-house of bones;<br />
  Her groans, her tears, the rue in her jet chalices;<br />
  But leave unmeasured more, Joy's fairy palaces.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The Angel spake: "Joy hath her limits set,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Sorrow hath no bounds&mdash;Joy is a guest<br />
  Perchance may enter; but no heart puls'd yet,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Sorrow did not lay her down to rest;<br />
  She hath no city by so many leagues confin'd,<br />
  I cannot measure bounds where there are none to find."<br />

  THE CANOE.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  My masters twain made me a bed<br />
  Of pine-boughs resinous, and cedar;<br />
  Of moss, a soft and gentle breeder<br />
  Of dreams of rest; and me they spread<br />
  With furry skins, and laughing said,<br />
  "Now she shall lay her polish'd sides,<br />
  As queens do rest, or dainty brides,<br />
  Our slender lady of the tides!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  My masters twain their camp-soul lit,<br />
  Streamed incense from the hissing cones,<br />
  Large, crimson flashes grew and whirl'd<br />
  Thin, golden nerves of sly light curl'd<br />
  Round the dun camp, and rose faint zones,<br />
  Half way about each grim bole knit,<br />
  Like a shy child that would bedeck<br />
  With its soft clasp a Brave's red neck;<br />
  Yet sees the rough shield on his breast,<br />
  The awful plumes shake on his crest,<br />
  And fearful drops his timid face,<br />
  Nor dares complete the sweet embrace.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Into the hollow hearts of brakes,<br />
  Yet warm from sides of does and stags,<br />
  Pass'd to the crisp dark river flags;<br />
  Sinuous, red as copper snakes,<br />
  Sharp-headed serpents, made of light,<br />
  Glided and hid themselves in night.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  My masters twain, the slaughtered deer<br />
  Hung on fork'd boughs&mdash;with thongs of leather.<br />
  Bound were his stiff, slim feet together&mdash;<br />
  His eyes like dead stars cold and drear;<br />
  The wand'ring firelight drew near<br />
  And laid its wide palm, red and anxious,<br />
  On the sharp splendor of his branches;<br />
  On the white foam grown hard and sere<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On flank and shoulder.<br />
  Death&mdash;hard as breast of granite boulder,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And under his lashes<br />
  Peer'd thro' his eyes at his life's grey ashes.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  My masters twain sang songs that wove<br />
  (As they burnish'd hunting blade and rifle)<br />
  A golden thread with a cobweb trifle&mdash;<br />
  Loud of the chase, and low of love.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "O Love, art thou a silver fish?<br />
  Shy of the line and shy of gaffing,<br />
  Which we do follow, fierce, yet laughing,<br />
  Casting at thee the light-wing'd wish,<br />
  And at the last shall we bring thee up<br />
  From the crystal darkness under the cup<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of lily folden,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On broad leaves golden?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "O Love! art thou a silver deer,<br />
  Swift thy starr'd feet as wing of swallow,<br />

  Woven of roses, of stars, of songs?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New chains all moulden<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of rare gems olden!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They hung the slaughter'd fish like swords<br />
  On saplings slender&mdash;like scimitars<br />
  Bright, and ruddied from new-dead wars,<br />
  Blaz'd in the light&mdash;the scaly hordes.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They piled up boughs beneath the trees,<br />
  Of cedar-web and green fir tassel;<br />
  Low did the pointed pine tops rustle,<br />
  The camp fire blush'd to the tender breeze.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The hounds laid dew-laps on the ground,<br />
  With needles of pine sweet, soft and rusty&mdash;<br />
  Dream'd of the dead stag stout and lusty;<br />
  A bat by the red flames wove its round.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The darkness built its wigwam walls<br />
  Close round the camp, and at its curtain<br />
  Press'd shapes, thin woven and uncertain,<br />
  As white locks of tall waterfalls.<br />

  By the jubilant shout of the blast<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To and fro, to and fro,<br />

  In its fire-puffed nostrils had it led<br />
  To the feet of the Queen as she sat by the King,<br />
  With the red crown set on her lily head;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she said&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Let the bull be led<br />
  To the floor<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the arena: Proclaim,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my name,<br />
  That the valliant and bold Toreador,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who slays him shall pull<br />
  The rubies and gold from the gore<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the bold white bull!'<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the voice blow<br />
  Of Pedro, the brawny young Toreador,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he swore<br />
  By the tremulous light of the golden star<br />
  That quivers beneath the soft lid<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Pilar,<br />
  Who sells tall lilies through fair Madrid;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He would wind six-fold<br />
  Round her neck, long, slender, round and full,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rubies and gold<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That three times rolled<br />
  Round the mighty breast of the bold white bull.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And loudly he sang,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the wine cups rang,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If I'm the bravest Toreador<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In gallant, gay Madrid,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If thou hast got the brightest eye<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That dances 'neath a lid;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If e'er of Andalusian wine<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I drank a bottle full,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold, the rubies shall be thine<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That deck the bold white bull.'<br />

  And the strings and voices are soulless and dull<br />
  That sound not the name of the bold white bull!"<br />

  When yellow-lock'd and crystal ey'd<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dream'd green woods among;<br />
  Where tall trees wav'd from side to side,<br />
  And in their green breasts deep and wide,<br />
  I saw the building blue jay hide,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O, then the earth was young!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The winds were fresh and brave and bold,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red sun round and strong;<br />

  "The green earth waxeth sere and old,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That once was fair and young!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I saw in scarr'd and knotty bole,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fresh'ning of the sap;<br />
  When timid spring gave first small dole,<br />
  Of sunbeams thro' bare boughs that stole,<br />
  I saw the bright'ning blossoms roll,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From summer's high pil'd lap.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And where an ancient oak tree lay<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forest stream across,<br />

  I watch'd the speckl'd trout at play,<br />
  I saw the shadows dance and sway<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On ripple and on moss.<br />

<p class="poem">
  I pull'd the chestnut branches low,<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The billowy clouds among.<br />

  I saw the stately planets sail<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that blue ocean wide;<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rust'ling boughs among,<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How fresh the earth and young!"<br />

  The winds were fresh, the days as clear<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As crystals set in gold.<br />

<h3>
  "THE WISHING STAR."<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Day floated down the sky; a perfect day,<br />
  Leaving a footprint of pale primrose gold<br />
  Along the west, that when her lover, Night,<br />
  Fled with his starry lances in pursuit,<br />
  Across the sky, the way she went might shew.<br />
  From the faint ting'd ridges of the sea, the Moon<br />
  Sprang up like Aphrodite from the wave,<br />
  Which as she climb'd the sky still held<br />
  Her golden tresses to its swelling breast,<br />
  Where wide dispread their quiv'ring glories lay,<br />
  (Or as the shield of night, full disk'd and red,<br />
  As flowers that look forever towards the Sun),<br />
  A terrace with a fountain and an oak<br />
  Look'd out upon the sea: The fountain danced<br />
  Beside the huge old tree as some slim nymph,<br />
  Rob'd in light silver might her frolics shew<br />
  Before some hoary king, while high above,<br />
  He shook his wild, long locks upon the breeze&mdash;<br />
  And sigh'd deep sighs of "All is vanity!"<br />
  Behind, a wall of Norman William's time<br />
  Rose mellow, hung with ivy, here and there<br />
  Torn wide apart to let a casement peer<br />
  Upon the terrace. On a carv'd sill I leant<br />
  (A fleur-de-lis bound with an English rose)<br />
  And look'd above me into two such eyes<br />
  As would have dazzl'd from that ancient page<br />
  That new old cry that hearts so often write<br />
  In their own ashes, "All is vanity!"<br />
  "Know'st thou&mdash;" she said, with tender eyes far-fix'd,<br />
  On the wide arch that domes our little earth,<br />
  "That when a star hurls on with shining wings,<br />
  "On some swift message from his throne of light,<br />
  "The ready heart may wish, and the ripe fruit&mdash;<br />
  "Fulfilment&mdash;drop into the eager palm?"<br />
  "Then let us watch for such a star," quoth I.<br />
  "Nay, love," she said, "'Tis but an idle tale."<br />
  But some swift feeling smote upon her brow<br />
  A rosy shadow. I turn'd and watch'd the sky&mdash;<br />
  Calmly the cohorts of the night swept on,<br />
  Led by the wide-wing'd vesper; and against the moon<br />
  Where low her globe trembl'd upon the edge<br />
  Of the wide amethyst that clearly paved<br />
  The dreamy sapphire of the night, there lay<br />
  The jetty spars of some tall ship, that look'd<br />
  The night's device upon his ripe-red shield.<br />
  And suddenly down towards the moon there ran&mdash;<br />
  From some high space deep-veil'd in solemn blue,<br />
  A little star, a point of trembling gold,<br />
  Gone swift as seen. "My wishing-star," quoth I,<br />
  "Shall tell my wish? Did'st note that little star?<br />
  "Its brightness died not, it but disappeared,<br />
  "To whirl undim'd thro' space. I wish'd our love<br />
  "Might blot the 'All is vanity' from this brief life,<br />
  "Burning brightly as that star and winging on<br />
  "Thro' unseen space of veil'd Eternity,<br />
  "Brightened by Immortality&mdash;not lost."<br />
  "Awful and sweet the wish!" she said, and so&mdash;<br />
  We rested in the silence of content.<br />

<h3>
  MY IRISH LOVE.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Beside the saffron of a curtain, lit<br />
  With broidered flowers, below a golden fringe<br />
  That on her silver shoulder made a glow,<br />
  Like the sun kissing lilies in the dawn;<br />
  She sat&mdash;my Irish love&mdash;slim, light and tall.<br />
  Between his mighty paws her stag-hound held,<br />
  (Love-jealous he) the foam of her pale robes,<br />
  Rare laces of her land, and his red eyes,<br />
  Half lov'd me, grown familiar at her side,<br />
  Half pierc'd me, doubting my soul's right to stand<br />
  His lady's wooer in the courts of Love.<br />
  Above her, knitted silver, fell a web<br />
  Of light from waxen tapers slipping down,<br />
  First to the wide-winged star of em'ralds set<br />
  On the black crown with its blue burnish'd points<br />
  Of raven light; thence, fonder, to the cheek<br />
  O'er which flew drifts of rose-leaves wild and rich,<br />
  With lilied pauses in the wine-red flight;<br />
  For when I whispered, like a wind in June,<br />
  My whisper toss'd the roses to and fro<br />
  In her dear face, and when I paus'd they lay<br />
  Still in her heart. Then lower fell the light.<br />
  A silver chisel cutting the round arm<br />
  Clear from the gloom; and dropped like dew<br />
  On the crisp lily, di'mond clasp'd, that lay<br />
  In happy kinship on her pure, proud breast,<br />
  And thence it sprang like Cupid, nimble-wing'd,<br />
  To the quaint love-ring on her finger bound<br />
  And set it blazing like a watch-fire, lit<br />
  To guard a treasure. Then up sprang the flame<br />
  Mad for her eyes, but those grey worlds were deep<br />
  In seas of native light: and when I spoke<br />
  They wander'd shining to the shining moon<br />
  That gaz'd at us between the parted folds<br />
  Of yellow, rich with gold and daffodils,<br />
  Dropping her silver cloak on Innisfail.<br />
  O worlds, those eyes! there Laughter lightly toss'd<br />
  His gleaming cymbals; Large and most divine<br />
  Pity stood in their crystal doors with hands<br />
  All generous outspread; in their pure depths<br />
  Mov'd Modesty, chaste goddess, snow-white of brow,<br />
  And shining, vestal limbs; rose-fronted stood<br />
  Blushing, yet strong; young Courage, knightly in<br />
  His virgin arms, and simple, russet Truth<br />
  Play'd like a child amongst her tender thoughts&mdash;<br />
  Thoughts white as daisies snow'd upon the lawn.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Unheeded, Dante on the cushion lay,<br />
  His golden clasps yet lock'd&mdash;no poet tells<br />
  The tale of Love with such a wizard tongue<br />
  That lovers slight dear Love himself to list.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Our wedding eve, and I had brought to her<br />
  The jewels of my house new set for her<br />
  (As I did set the immemorial pearl<br />
  Of our old honour in the virgin gold<br />
  Of her high soul) with grave and well pleased eyes,<br />
  And critic lips, and kissing finger tips,<br />
  She prais'd the bright tiara and its train<br />
  Of lesser splendours&mdash;nor blush'd nor smil'd:<br />
  They were but fitting pages to her state,<br />
  And had no tongues to speak between our souls.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But I would have her smile ripe for me then,<br />
  Swift treasure of a moment&mdash;so I laid<br />
  Between her palms a little simple thing,<br />
  A golden heart, grav'd with my name alone,<br />
  And round it, twining close, small shamrocks link'd<br />
  Of gold, mere gold: no jewels made it rich,<br />
  Until twin di'monds shatter'd from her eyes<br />
  And made the red gold rare. "True Knight," she said,<br />
  "Your English heart with Irish shamrocks bound!"<br />
  "A golden prophet of eternal truth,"<br />
  I said, and kissed the roses of her palms,<br />
  And then the shy, bright roses of her lips,<br />
  And all the jealous jewels shone forgot<br />
  In necklace and tiara, as I clasp'd<br />
  The gold heart and its shamrocks round her neck.<br />
  My fair, pure soul! My noble Irish love!<br />
</p>

  Meself was tyin' on there bits of clothes,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their mother (rest her tender sowl!) was dead.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  It's not meself can say of what she died;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But t'was the year the praties felt the rain,<br />
  And rotted in the soil; an' just to dhraw<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breath of life was one long hungry pain.<br />
  If we were haythens in a furrin' land,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not in a country grand in Christian pride,<br />
  Faith, then a man might have the face to say<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas of stharvation my poor Shylie died.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But whin the parish docthor come at last,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whin death was like a sun-burst in her eyes,<br />
  (They looked straight into heaven) an her ears<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wor deaf to the poor childer's hungry cries;<br />
  He touched the bones stretched on the mouldy sthraw;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She's gone!" he says, and drew a solemn frown;<br />
  "I fear, my man, she's dead." "Of what?" says I.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He coughed, and says, "She's let her system down!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "An' that's God's truth!" says I, an' felt about<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To touch her dawney hand, for all looked dark,<br />
  An' in my hunger-bleached, shmall-beatin' heart,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt the kindlin' of a burning spark.<br />
  "O, by me sowl, that is the holy truth!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's Rosie's cheek has kept a dimple still,<br />
  An' Mickie's eyes are bright&mdash;the craythur there<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Died that the weeny ones might eat there fill."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  An' whin they spread the daisies thick and white,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above her head that wanst lay on my breast,<br />
  I had no tears, but took the childhers' hands,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An' says, "We'll lave the mother to her rest,"<br />
  An' och! the sod was green that summers day;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An' rainbows crossed the low hills, blue an' fair;<br />
  But black an' foul the blighted furrows stretched,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An' sent their cruel poison through the air.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  An' all was quiet&mdash;on the sunny sides<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of hedge an' ditch  the stharvin' craythurs lay,<br />
  An' thim as lack'd the rint from empty walls<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of little cabins, wapin' turned away.<br />
  God's curse lay heavy on the poor ould sod,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An' whin upon her increase His right hand<br />
  Fell with'ringly, there samed no bit of blue<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Hope to shine through on the sthricken land.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  No facthory chimblys shmoked agin the sky,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No mines yawn'd on the hills so full an' rich;<br />
  A man whose praties failed had nought to do,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But fold his hands an' die down in a ditch!<br />
  A flame rose up widin me feeble heart,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whin passin' through me cabin's hingeless dure,<br />
  I saw the mark of Shylie's coffin in<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grey dust on the empty earthen flure.<br />

<p class="poem">
  I lifted Rosie's face betwixt me hands;<br />

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
